	- #### Exponential smoothing method:
		- Can take care of sales in certain periods influencing the forcast in other periods
		- F $_{t+1}$ = F $_t$ + a(D$_t$ + F$_t$)
		- F$_{t+1}$: Exponentially smoothened forcast for period t+1
		- F$_t$ : Exponentially smoothened forcast for period t
		- D$_t$ : Actual demand during period t
		- a : Smoothening coefficient
