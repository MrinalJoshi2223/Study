# T-test
- there are many type of t-test
| t-test | uses |
|-|-|
| One-sample T-test | to test the difference between sample mean and population mean |
| Independent sample T-test | To test the difference between two imdependent sample means |
| Pared sample T-test | To test the difference between pre and post even outcomes |







# test and there hypothesis
| test | Hypothesis | meaning|
|-|-|-|
| t-test | Null Hypothesis (Ho) | There is nno significant difference|
|  | Alternate Hypothysis (H1) | there is a significant difference|
| chisquare test | Null Hypothesis (Ho) | There is no assocition|
| | Alternate Hypothesis (H1) | There is a association |
| Corelation | Null hypothesis (H0) | Thre is no significant relationship |
|| Alternate hypothesis (H1) | There exists a significant Relationship|
| Regression | Null hypothesis (H0) | There is no significant impact |
|| Alaternate Hypothesis (H1) | There exists a significant impact |
| one-way anova | Null hypothesis (H0) | all group means are equal |
|| Alternate Hypothesis (H1) | all group means are significantly different |


# Z-test
# anova
# Correlation
- it is used to test the degree of relation between two variable
 | corelation co efficient (r) | relation |
 |-|-|
 | + - 0.15  | no corelation|
 | + - 0.15 to +- 0.35 | low |
 | +- 0.35 to +- 0.65 | medium |
 | +- 0.65 to +- 1 | strong relation |

- here in answer the corelation between *traning score and traning score* is **1** 
- and *performance and performance* is also **1**
- but the correlation between *traning score and performance* is **0.879377942** which shows **strong correlation**

# Regression
- dependent and indipendant variable
- to test the **cause and effect of relation between two variable** or the study the impact use *regression*


# chi-square
- To test the **goodness of fit**, *chi-square* is used
