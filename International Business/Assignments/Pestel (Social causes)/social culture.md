	- - The brand name “Kit Kat” was transliterated into “Kitto katto” (キットカット) in Japanese, which phonetically mirrors the phrase “kitto katsu” (きっと勝つ).
	- When Coca-Cola first appeared in China in 1927, the company’s name was transliterated into Chinese characters rather than renamed completely. The first iterations of those translations resulted in company names like “female horse fastened with wax” and “bite the wax tadpole.” In 1928, Coca-Cola changed its name to be both a close transliteration and more accurate representation of the message of the brand. Coca-Cola, or “Ke kou ke le” (可口可乐) in Mandarin, now translates to “permit mouth to be able to rejoice” or “delicious happiness.”
	- “eat your fingers off” (instead of “finger licking good”).
	- “Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave” (instead of “Pepsi brings you back to life”)
	- includes the naming of sports car company Mercedes Benz as “Bensi” in Mandarin, which can translate to “rush to die.” This was later corrected to “Benchi” (奔驰) or “galloping.”
