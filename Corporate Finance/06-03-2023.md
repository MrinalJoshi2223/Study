	- not distributing all the profits to the shareholders and investing some profit back in the business
	- ##### Retained earning : 
		- profit kept aside for future investment

___
## WACC (Waighted average cost of capital)

>[!example]

| share | Amount | percentage | waight| Percentage X Waight |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Equity | 100000 | 14% | 100000/305000 = 0.328 | (14/100)\*0.328|
|re | 80000| 14% | 800000/305000= 0.26|(14/100)\*0.26|
|Deb|75000|10%|75000/305000 = 0.25|(10/100)\*0.25|
|LTB|50000|12%|50000/305000 = 0.163|(12/100)\*0.163
| **Total** | *305000* ||**WACC**|*0.126*|
**this means Wacc in % =** *0.126\*100 = 12.6%*

**Question 16)** Using the information given in the table below, calculate the market portfolio returns and the expected returns on secutity using CAPM. The risk free return in 14%
Portfolio of an investor
|Investment|Initial Price (1)| Dividends (2)|Year-end Market Price (3)|Beta (4)|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Shares of cement | 30| 3|50|0.8|
|Shares of steel|45|3|60|0.7|
|Shares of Liquor|55|3|135|0.5|
|Government Sector Firm| 1000|150|1015|0.99|

**Solution :**
|Investment|Divedends (1)|Capital appreciation (3-1)|Total Returns (Div+Cap_app)|Investment|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Shares of Cement|3|50-30=20|23|30|
|Shares of steel|3|60-45=15|83|55|
|Shares of Liquor|3|135-55=80|165|1000|
|Government Sector Firms|150|1015-1000=15|165|1000|
|**Total**|*159*|*130*|*289*|*1130*|
Total Investment = 1130
Returns = 289
Rm=(Returns/Total investment)\*100
Rm =(289/1130)\*100 = *25.575%*
