|Capital|Rs. in lakhs|
|-|-|
|Equity ccapital (10 lakhs shares at par value) (*face value =10*)|100|
|12% Preference capital (10000 shares ar par value) (*face value =100*)|10|
|Retained earnings|120|

|Capital|Rs. in lakhs|Cost of capitals|Book value weights|ss|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Equity ccapital (10 lakhs shares at par value) (*face value =10*)|100|Ke=2+8%=25,<br>KE=16%=0.16|0.25=100/400
|12% Preference capital (10000 shares ar par value) (*face value =100*)|10|KP=12+(100-75)/7<br>(100+75)/2<br>kp=17.8%|0.025=10/400
|Retained earnings|120|Kre=ke=16%|0.3|4.8%
