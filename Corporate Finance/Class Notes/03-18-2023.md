	- we don't consider time value of money
	- #### Payback Period (PBP) Method
		- **payback =** *Initial investment / annual cash inflow* = C$_o$ / C
		- it is how quickly you are getting your investment
		- **Prob :**
			- Mohan & co. is considering the purchase of a machine two machine x and y each costing Rs. 50000 are available, cash flows are expected to be as under. Calculate the pay back period
			- ![[raw#^probl1on18-03]]
		- *solution*
			- PBP for Machine X = 2years + 15000/25000 = 0.6 years
			- PBP for Machine X = 2.6 years
	- #### Accounting rate of return
		- it considers the earnings of the project for the economic life
		- Ther rate of terurn is expressed as the percentage of the earnings
		- of the investment in a perticular project.
