# Discounting technique
- Steps involved in NPV method are:
	1) Forecasting the cash flows, both inflow and outflow of the projects to be taken up for execution
		- inflow: money earned by investment
		- outflow: money put in investment
	2) Decision on discount factor or interest factor. the approprate discount rate is the firm's cost of capital or required rate of return expected by the investors
	3) Computation of the total present value of cash inflows and outflows using the discount factor selected
	4) Calculation of NPV by substract...
- decision based on NPV
	- NPV<0
		- something
	- NPV>0
		- something
	- NPV=0
		- something


# Steps to find NPV
- Step 1:
	- Initial Investment/Avg Annual Cash flow
- Step 2:
	- Refer the PVAF table under for 6 years and find at what rate you get
- Step 3: 
	- Cut foo rate from which you can start calculating NPV and attive at the rate at which NPV is zero

**Prob :**
	Determine the ARR from the following ARR from the following details of two machines X and Y
	![[Class Notes/raw#^prob20-03]]Depreciation has been charged on straight line method
*Sol :*
	Avg Annual Income = 36875/5 = 7375
	Average Investment = (Orignal Investment - Scrap value + (Additional Working Capital + Scrap Value))/2
	(56125-300 + (6000+3000))/2 = 35563
	ARR for Machine X = 7375/35563=20.73%
	Decision : Machine X can be selected as it haas higher ARR


**Prob**
	A company is considering investment in purchasing a Machine. The machine that has been shortlisted by the manager are A and B. The details of the machine are as follows:
	Both the Machines cost Rs. 50000 each
	PAT are expected to be as follows:
	![[Class Notes/raw#^prob220-03]]
	Evaluate the two alternatives according to 
	a. PBP
	b. Return on investment method
	Assume straight line method of depreciation
*Sol :*
	![[Class Notes/raw#^probl1on18-03]]
	- PBP for Machine X = 2years + 15000/25000 = 0.6 years
	- PBP for Machine X = 2.6 years


**Prob :**
	A project costs Rs. 250000 and is expected to generate cash inflows.
	The following table show the cash inflows
	Cash Inflows
	![[Class Notes/raw#^prob320-03]]
	The cost of capital is 12%. you are required to calculate the NPV of the Project
	The following table shows the present value factors.


**Prob :**
	Find out the NPV for a project which requires an initial investment of RS. 20000 and which invlolves a net cash flows of Rs. 6000 each year for 6 year. The cost of funds is 8%. There is no scrap value
	![[Class Notes/raw#^prob420-03]]
	Profitablity index = total inflow/total outflow = 27736.8/20000 = 1.38684
