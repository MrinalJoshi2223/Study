1
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,978
What's with you? Out in the
middle of the night, dressed to kill?

2
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,103
To meet you, darling.

3
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,520
To get my fill.

4
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,895
- Dunk fight?
- It's been ages, man.

5
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:00,812
That is exactly what I was wondering...

6
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:04,228
...there is no way I can spend the
whole night mugging up quantum physics.

7
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,520
Who shall be our first target?

8
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:15,645
Our first target cannot be
someone who is submissive or too easy.

9
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:18,520
Instead, someone who upon getting drenched
retaliates with a lot more aggression.

10
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:20,395
I found our target.

11
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,103
Where?

12
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,062
Here.

13
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,437
Traitor!

14
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:30,728
You've challenged a snake
by hitting where it hurts the most!

15
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:33,687
What's going on?

16
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,312
Dunk fight!

17
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:36,645
Oh damn...!

18
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,520
Get him!

19
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:36,478
- Feels amazing, doesn't it, bro?
- No.

20
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,437
Let's go to H3.

21
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I've heard that when dogs get drenched,
they get offended really easily.

22
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:43,728
Everyone!

23
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:46,728
H3...

24
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,103
Attack!

25
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,353
Who is it?

26
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,395
Your pregnant girlfriend.

27
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,062
You bloody...!

28
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,937
Would you want to drown alone or do you
want the entire room to drown with you?

29
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,478
- Look, Anni...
- Shhh...

30
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,978
Hold him tight!

31
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,228
Oh yeah!

32
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:21,687
- Use your might!
- Oh yeah!

33
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,395
- Serve him right!
- Oh yeah!

34
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,187
- Now we fight!
- Oh yeah!

35
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,728
Bloody Coward.

36
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,895
Bloody losers.

37
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Your dad is a loser!

38
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:48,228
<i>"The journey of these memories will
continue with songs from the 90's. </i>

39
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,687
<i>I'm your friend</i>

40
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,103
You're home late today?

41
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,145
Shall I serve dinner?

42
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,520
- Has Raghav eaten?
- He hasn't been eating.

43
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,478
Ever since he's written
his entrance exams...

44
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:15,520
...the fear of the result
has been eating him alive.

45
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:18,937
Where is he?

46
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:22,812
Set a plate for him.

47
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,603
Are you sleeping?

48
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,437
I would be if you let me.

49
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,645
I wanted to clear a doubt.
I promise this will be the last time.

50
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:29,687
Same old story.

51
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,145
Which one was tougher, this
time's entrance exam or last time's?

52
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:36,312
Who did well in the mathematics,
just you or everyone?

53
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:39,437
Who didn't do well in physics,
just you or everyone?

54
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,312
This is what you want to know, right?

55
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,728
Sorry, man.
I am just a little worried.

56
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,020
Why suffer alone then?

57
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,353
Let's wake Sooraj up as well.

58
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:52,603
Yes, Raghav?

59
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,603
Are you sleeping?

60
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,062
Not at all, I just had a bubble bath.

61
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:57,228
Tell me.

62
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,145
Raghav is worried about his results.

63
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,312
Do something, bro.

64
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,895
I know that we are the friends whom
you can call at any time of the day...

65
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,645
But this is you taking undue
advantage of our friendship.

66
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,062
Look, the arrow has been shot.

67
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,895
The results will be out in a few days.

68
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:13,437
Soon we will know who hit
the target and who missed.

69
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,853
Please go to sleep.
And let us sleep as well.

70
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:23,728
What's up, master?

71
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,770
Enjoy the good food while you can.

72
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,020
- Sorry, papa.
- Don't apologise.

73
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,353
You'll be staying in
a hostel in a few days.

74
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,437
Do you have any idea
what hostel food tastes like?

75
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:41,895
The chances of you puking it out are
higher than you digesting it properly.

76
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,478
I'll tolerate that as well, papa.

77
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,645
I just want to get selected.

78
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,187
Ofcourse you'll get selected.

79
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,353
You have studied hard.

80
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:50,437
You have written your papers well.

81
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,062
You are unnecessarily getting worried.

82
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,478
Weren't you worried?

83
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, come on.

84
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:56,895
Why would you be worried anyway?

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,645
You were a genius.

86
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,895
Your All India Rank was 384.

87
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:04,478
I'll go crazy even if
I am anywhere in the top 2000.

88
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:06,728
Over the last two months,
you've lost your mind...

89
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,812
...worrying about all of this.

90
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,978
You should have gotten
yourself a girlfriend instead.

91
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:14,020
Do you know there is a huge shortage
of girls in an engineering college?

92
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,687
- Didn't you meet mom there?
- Didn't you meet mom there! (mockingly)

93
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,228
But not everyone is
as unfortunate as your dad.

94
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:22,520
Okay?
Come on now, start eating.

95
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,020
You are personally dropping
me to mom's place today.

96
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,728
Why are you doing such a huge favour?

97
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:51,520
I was thinking I should
spend some more time with you.

98
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,478
You'll be staying in a hostel soon...

99
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:55,728
...and your mom will
take up the whole day.

100
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,103
Don't say that.

101
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,228
I feel like meeting her too.

102
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,645
I know everything.
You only go there to hog.

103
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:03,728
Rubbish.

104
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:05,395
I know your kind quite well.

105
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,562
Two milkshakes were enough
to bribe them in the hostel.

106
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,312
Let me know if you have a better plan.

107
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:10,770
I won't go.

108
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,270
I have some of the
best plans under my sleeve...

109
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:14,645
...and you know that too.

110
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,145
But you should go,
poor thing must be waiting for you.

111
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,562
Poor thing! Right!

112
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:24,853
You may be divorced, but there is
still something between you two.

113
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:28,353
You, of course!

114
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,895
At least come in to say hi.

115
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:56,437
No thanks, she's all yours.

116
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:01,895
Listen... if she has made
something nice, pack some for me.

117
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:03,562
Go now.

118
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,937
Please eat well.

119
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,728
Results will be out in a few days.

120
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,520
Yes, so?

121
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,478
What do you think?

122
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,228
Will I clear it?

123
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:23,520
Honestly, it's not a big
deal even if you don't get in.

124
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,562
Dad thinks that I will.

125
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,395
Aniruddh is just too much.

126
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:34,687
Listen, don't feel pressurised
by what he says. Okay?

127
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:36,728
He isn't pressurising me.

128
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:38,937
I know him quite well.

129
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,603
Then you also know how
much he loves Okra, right?

130
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,187
Yes, I have made extra.

131
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:47,020
Love you!

132
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,937
Daddy's yes man!

133
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:57,812
Always on your phone!

134
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:00,770
- What's up, champion?
- All good.

135
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,228
This is for you.

136
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:14,187
Wow. Anyway, forget this.

137
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,062
Look at what I got for you.

138
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,645
The day you get your results...

139
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,853
...both father and son
will celebrate that day.

140
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,270
We'll polish it off.

141
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,520
Papa, you are pressurising me now.

142
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:37,187
Kid! This doesn't increase, instead
it releases all sorts of pressures!

143
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:43,895
After you go, all I will
be left with are your memories.

144
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,062
Everything will be fine.

145
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,353
Come on.

146
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,228
Boo!

147
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:18,478
"It seems like just yesterday..."

148
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:26,812
"It seems like just yesterday..."

149
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:34,478
"When I first held you in my arms"

150
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:41,270
"The emotions I was unaware of..."

151
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:50,812
"Were introduced to me by you"

152
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,812
"Your smiles..."

153
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,187
How is it?

154
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,312
"Were a boon gift-wrapped for me"

155
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:13,520
"You kept silent,
while your eyes spoke volumes"

156
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:22,187
"You brought joy back
into my lonely life"

157
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:30,187
"When I first held you in my arms"

158
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:33,353
"It seems like just yesterday..."

159
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,812
It's very good.

160
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:42,812
"It seems like just yesterday..."

161
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:50,228
"It seems like just yesterday..."

162
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
What happened?
Why are you so worried?

163
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:57,853
You check this one for me.

164
00:12:57,937 --> 00:12:59,520
You're a dude! Chill!

165
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:12,562
What happened?

166
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,270
But your exams went really well.

167
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,978
I am really tensed, Aniruddh.

168
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,812
I just spoke to Raghav.

169
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,478
He couldn't stop crying.

170
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:00,020
I really tried to make him understand.

171
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,187
He was just not willing to listen.

172
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,228
I did everything possible.

173
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,478
I gave up everything.
I studied for 18 hours a day.

174
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,687
I still didn't get in.

175
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,853
If not this year, he can try next year.

176
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,353
Not everyone clears these
exams in the first attempt anyway.

177
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,937
How can you take everything so lightly?

178
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,978
Why do you take everything seriously?

179
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:26,478
Satish... he used to always lag behind.

180
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,520
Even he managed to get in.

181
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,895
Everyone must be laughing at me.

182
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,145
Raghav...

183
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,353
And how will I face my parents?

184
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,645
I'm going to meet him.
By when are you going to come?

185
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,312
I just have one meeting left
for the day, right after I finish that.

186
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,895
Keep attending your meetings!

187
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:50,228
Mom is a ranker, dad too.

188
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:52,562
And their son, a loser.

189
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,603
Raghav, just chill, bro.

190
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,103
You don't understand.

191
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,562
I'll have to live with this
'Loser tag' for the rest of my life.

192
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,812
Now you're just pressurising
yourself too much.

193
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:09,853
No.

194
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,853
Everything is over.

195
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:18,020
It's all over!

196
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:30,728
Raghav!

197
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:33,562
Raghav!

198
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:42,437
And then we have to measure it
quarterly for sure.

199
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,353
So we have to make sure...

200
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:45,353
Just a second.

201
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:49,687
Son, I am in a meeting.
I'll call you back.

202
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,353
Uncle... Raghav...

203
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,812
Raghav has fallen.

204
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:56,404
Huh?

205
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,893
I've called the ambulance.

206
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:17,770
How did this happen?

207
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,228
He was quite upset, uncle.

208
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:26,062
He said everyone would
call him a loser now.

209
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:29,853
I really tried to make him understand.

210
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,978
And even before I could react,
he jumped.

211
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,103
I'm sorry uncle.

212
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,812
It's all my fault.

213
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,270
I shouldn't have given
Raghav's custody to you.

214
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,937
You think all of this
has happened because of me?

215
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,228
He was under so much pressure
and you didn't even realise!

216
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,437
He has tried to commit suicide.

217
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,437
How would I know, Maya...

218
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:14,145
...that he would take
such a drastic step?

219
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:15,478
What do you even know, Anni?

220
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:18,395
Except for your meetings and your work?

221
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:21,603
Neither did you try understanding me,
nor your son.

222
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,395
Please keep quiet.
Everyone is listening.

223
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,020
So let them!

224
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,437
Even they should know what
an irresponsible father you are.

225
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,145
- Because of you my son...
- Please stop it.

226
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,687
Our son is not dead.

227
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:02,562
Excuse me?

228
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:05,812
Please come with me.

229
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,901
I won't give you any false assurances.

230
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:15,985
Your son has suffered
a severe brain injury.

231
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,485
Multiple organs are damaged as well.

232
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:26,610
For now, we have performed a
surgery to stop the internal bleeding.

233
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:29,276
We have also removed
clots from the brain.

234
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,235
But that's not all.

235
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:36,360
He has contusions in his brain.

236
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,776
If these contusions increase...

237
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,818
...the swelling in the
brain will increase too.

238
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:46,776
For which,
we might have to go for another surgery.

239
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:52,485
We are keeping him under observation
in the ICU for the time being.

240
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,860
Till he stabilises.

241
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:58,235
He is extremely critical.

242
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,610
But he will survive, right?

243
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,776
We are trying our best.

244
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,610
Doctor, can we meet him?

245
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,193
Please sir, just once.

246
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,318
I cannot see him like this.

247
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,401
You go ahead.

248
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,068
This is not fair, man!

249
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,568
Raghav!

250
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:03,235
I feel like hurling abuses at you.

251
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:06,610
I've been tolerating your
drama for the last two years now.

252
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,401
"Papa, I have a mock test."

253
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:17,151
"I won't watch the movie."

254
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:22,318
"Papa, let me get done with my
exams and then we'll go on a vacation."

255
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,026
"Papa, I have to
go study with my group."

256
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,526
"I don't have time to talk to you."

257
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,485
Oh come on, man!

258
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,318
For the last two years, all your
dad has been doing is waiting for you.

259
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,943
Just how much more do I need to wait?

260
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:42,651
Shit!

261
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:25,318
Doctor?

262
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,068
Be strong.

263
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:55,860
Nurse, what...?

264
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:58,651
He has sepsis because of the infection.

265
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,943
Therefore,
his kidneys aren't functioning right.

266
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:02,526
That is why we have put him on dialysis.

267
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:03,901
Excuse me.

268
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,776
I understand your concern, Mr. Pathak.

269
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,485
But there is only so
much medicines can do.

270
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:13,318
The patient also needs to respond.

271
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:17,568
And Raghav's body isn't responding.

272
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:24,526
I've seen many cases where even
the most critical patients survive.

273
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:28,151
Because they want to live.

274
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,610
Your son's case is just the opposite.

275
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:33,068
Looks like...

276
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,276
...he doesn't want to live.

277
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:40,610
And that's not a very good sign.

278
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:49,651
'Looks like he doesn't want to live.'

279
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:52,068
'And that's not a very good sign.'

280
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,568
'He said everyone would
call him a loser now.'

281
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:58,818
'Bloody losers.'

282
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,776
'Your dad is a loser'

283
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:02,401
You.....

284
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,735
You know this is a stupid idea, right?

285
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,026
I don't know, Maya.

286
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:14,068
But all I know is that...

287
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:18,151
...he doesn't want to live
because he thinks he's a loser.

288
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,943
And no one can understand
this better than you and I...

289
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:25,568
That we wear the loser tag ourselves,
and we get rid of it ourselves too.

290
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:27,943
How will you tell him that?

291
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,610
Can he hear you?

292
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:31,568
I don't know.

293
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,651
You have gone mad.

294
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,026
Son, you think that
you are a loser, right?

295
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,735
Today I'll tell you what
big a loser your father was.

296
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:56,360
And the people he spent the most
beautiful moments of his life with...

297
00:24:57,901 --> 00:24:59,860
They were all big losers too.

298
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:10,026
'National College of Technology,
Bombay.'

299
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,276
'India's best engineering college.'

300
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:16,401
'Everyone said that your life will
change if you manage to get in here.'

301
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,193
'I had no idea how much
my life was about to change.'

302
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,943
Next.

303
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:23,860
Aniruddh Pathak.

304
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,026
Anni.

305
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,943
- Anni.
- Not Anni, Aniruddh Pathak.

306
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,985
This is hostel life, son.

307
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,068
Deshpande becomes Despo here.

308
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,443
Patwardhan becomes Pattu.

309
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,068
- Chaudhary becomes Cho...
- Okay, got it.

310
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:39,235
- Please...
- Anni, Anni, Anni...

311
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:40,443
Oh no.

312
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,485
What happened?
My name is not on the list?

313
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,568
It would be better
if it wasn't on this list.

314
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:45,401
Why?

315
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,443
Because you've been allotted
Hostel No. 4. H4.

316
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,193
So?

317
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:54,068
This institute's most useless,
jobless and...

318
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,568
- Worthless?
- Yes, worthless lot can be found in H4.

319
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,401
They are addressed as
"Losers" in this institute.

320
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:01,443
Losers?

321
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:05,860
Take my advice and put in a request for
change of hostel at the next counter.

322
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:09,610
If you are lucky,
your hostel will change.

323
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,068
Otherwise?

324
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:12,818
Otherwise, your life will change.

325
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:15,276
Listen mister, I am more notorious
than most notorious of them all.

326
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,568
H4 is no biggie.

327
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:17,735
Amazing.

328
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,151
Soon you'll get a taste of it.

329
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,526
Have a go at it then.

330
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,068
You'll come running back. It's
not like the counter is going anywhere.

331
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:29,151
'And I wondered what
could be so bad in H4.'

332
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,693
Oh Kammo,
you are finally here to perform.

333
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,443
How much do you charge per hour?

334
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:37,860
What's happening, guys?

335
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,276
Sir, Silk Smitha!

336
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:46,068
Rascal!

337
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:48,318
Go.

338
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,610
Hey!

339
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:00,776
'These were the seniors of H4.'

340
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,735
My bathroom back home
is bigger than this.

341
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,068
'This was the room of H4'

342
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:13,068
'This was the food of H4'

343
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,943
Excuse me,
are these potatoes or pumpkins?

344
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:19,818
Find out for yourself!

345
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:21,860
'And that's it, my decision was made.'

346
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,443
'I was scared about two things.'

347
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,568
- 'One: What will happen if my
hostel doesn't change?' - Hey, freshie!

348
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:42,276
'Two: What will happen
until my hostel isn't changed?'

349
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,068
They bash you with a rod.

350
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:46,776
They make you pee on an electric heater.

351
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:49,235
The strip you and make
you sit on a beer bottle.

352
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:51,151
Come here.

353
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,735
You are a mermaid.

354
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:55,318
And you are a heron.

355
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,485
You have fallen in
love with the mermaid.

356
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:06,735
Oh... so you think this is funny?

357
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,318
Come here.

358
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,776
What's your name?

359
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,360
Aniruddh Pathak.
Anni.

360
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,693
Okay Anni,
my boy, how about a pole dance?

361
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,610
Danda?

362
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:16,818
You are his pole.

363
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,401
Get started, Anni.

364
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:29,360
'And I was wondering when the dancing
would stop and the bashing would begin.'

365
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:30,735
Stop.

366
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,860
Is this how you dance?

367
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:35,443
Well, I...

368
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:37,151
Move.

369
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:38,151
I'll show you how it's done.

370
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:42,276
'But the horrific ragging that
I had imagined never materialised.'

371
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Music.

372
00:28:50,818 --> 00:28:53,235
'These seniors weren't so cruel...

373
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:57,943
...that they'll beat up their
juniors just because they are helpless.'

374
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:02,151
'All they wanted was some harmless fun.'

375
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,318
'He was our Loser No. 1.'

376
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:09,651
'Sexa.'

377
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:10,651
Sexa?

378
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:14,485
His nickname.

379
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:18,776
Because one thing always
kept his mind occupied.

380
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,776
Sex?

381
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:21,901
Correct.

382
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,110
Continue.

383
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:26,235
'He was the most desperate
guy of our hostel.'

384
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:27,693
Which one would you like, Kammo?

385
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:32,276
Playboy, Debonair,
Dafa 302, Mastram or, Rangeen Raatein?

386
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:33,693
I have regional stuff as well.

387
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:37,235
'He had a fixed front seat
during hostel's porn show nights.'

388
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,985
'And the biggest bidder of
hostel's porn auction was...'

389
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,026
One rupee 25 paise!

390
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,860
- 'Sexa.'
- Oh!

391
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,735
One rupee 50 paise!

392
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:50,318
Oh!

393
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:51,901
Three rupees.

394
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,443
Oh!

395
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:57,860
Going once,
going twice, sold for three rupees!

396
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:10,568
Call the doctor!

397
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:12,568
- Nurse, What happened?
- His BP is fluctuating.

398
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:13,318
Means?

399
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:15,776
Please wait outside.
Doctor will monitor him. Please.

400
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:32,776
You are harming him, not helping him.

401
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,193
Sir, sir, is...

402
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,151
He is okay.

403
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:50,318
This happens when the patient
tries to gain consciousness.

404
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:51,360
Thank God.

405
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:52,943
He has only regained consciousness.

406
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,235
His condition hasn't improved.

407
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:00,568
By the way, who's Sexa?

408
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,026
He was listening.

409
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:09,193
- Doctor, can we...?
- Yeah, yeah.

410
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:26,193
Hi.

411
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,443
Get well soon, man.

412
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:39,276
Everything will be fine.

413
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,276
Papa...

414
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,735
Yes?

415
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,318
Is it true?

416
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:48,776
What, son?

417
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:51,026
Losers?

418
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:53,985
Sexa?

419
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:55,526
Porn?

420
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,651
Of course, it is true.

421
00:31:58,193 --> 00:31:59,360
It is true, right Maya?

422
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,610
It is true.

423
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:01,818
It's all in here.

424
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:18,235
He is liking the story
but he isn't believing it.

425
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,693
He regained consciousness because of
doctor's treatment and not your story.

426
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,985
Okay then let the doctors
and the medicines do their job.

427
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:32,735
And let me do my job.

428
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,568
Treating hours are theirs.
And the visiting hours are mine.

429
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:40,901
It will work out
well if Sexa comes here.

430
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:42,610
Sexa? Here?

431
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:45,818
Do you even know where he is?

432
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:47,193
Oh.

433
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,485
We have gotten so busy with work...

434
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,485
...that we haven't even bothered
to stay in touch with our friends.

435
00:32:58,235 --> 00:32:59,485
Anyway, he has to be somewhere.

436
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:02,068
On Google, Facebook...

437
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:03,651
Tinder?

438
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,151
But how will I find him?

439
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:11,193
What was Sexa's full name?

440
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:13,776
You should know.
He was from your hostel.

441
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,651
No but everyone in the
hostel would only call him Sexa.

442
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:19,985
What was Sexa's full name?

443
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:22,610
Mamta Kulkarni!

444
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:23,860
Excuse me?

445
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,776
Where can I find Gurmeet Singh Dhillon?

446
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,026
His father.

447
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:28,026
Gurmeet Singh Dhillon?

448
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,110
Who is that?

449
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:33,901
Second year, mechanical engineering,
fair, chubby and with curly hair.

450
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:34,943
- Sexa?
- Yes.

451
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:37,860
Uncle, Room No. 152... 152.

452
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:39,651
Sexa?

453
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:43,151
Gurmeet Singh Dhillon.

454
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,068
Had I known then,
I could have saved him.

455
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,735
So this is what you study here?

456
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:53,068
No, daddy.
They belong to my friends.

457
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:55,735
Right, your friends.

458
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:57,610
And why do they call you Sexa?

459
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:03,068
Because I look very sexy.

460
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,526
Hmm.

461
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:20,318
So that's the point I'm trying to make,
gentlemen.

462
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:23,651
If you see the global trends,
that's where the market is headed.

463
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:25,735
- That's why you guys need our expert...
- Excuse me.

464
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:28,193
Sir, there is a call for you.

465
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,401
Not now.

466
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,401
He said to tell you
he is someone from Hostel 4.

467
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,110
Excuse me.

468
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:41,151
Hello?

469
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:43,110
Am I speaking to Gurmeet Singh?

470
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,360
Yes.

471
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,818
Sexa, it's me, Anni!

472
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,193
Kammo, you cheapster!

473
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:53,651
Wretch! Dog shit...

474
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:00,860
Excuse me, gentlemen.

475
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:24,151
Sharron, cancel all my
meetings for the next week.

476
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:25,985
Any problem, sir?

477
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,526
I have to go to India.

478
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:41,776
How are you doing, Kammo?

479
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,401
I never imagined we would have
had a reunion in these circumstances.

480
00:35:57,693 --> 00:35:59,193
I am so sorry.

481
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:05,276
How can such young
kids take such a big step?

482
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:10,360
Let's go.

483
00:36:15,401 --> 00:36:16,401
Raghav?

484
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,276
Look who's here to meet you.

485
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,026
Guess who?

486
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,943
Which one would you like, Kammo?

487
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:33,151
Playboy, Debonair,
Mastram, Dafa 302 or...

488
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,318
Rangeen Raatein?

489
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:39,151
Sexa uncle?

490
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,526
You're a smart guy, Kammo.

491
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:45,276
Thank god you got hit here and not here.

492
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,485
Otherwise, that would've been a bummer!

493
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:50,860
I was a year senior to your father.

494
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:54,693
I don't know why,
but he wanted to change his hostel.

495
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:58,151
Sir, what's the status
of my hostel change request?

496
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,651
Everyone's details have
been sent to other hostels.

497
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,860
If you get selected, you can celebrate.

498
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:05,401
Otherwise?

499
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,735
You'll have to try to survive.

500
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,735
What happened, Kammo?

501
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:12,235
Still stuck in the waiting list?

502
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,193
No sir, I was...

503
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:15,401
What will you accomplish
by changing your hostel?

504
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,860
You will stay in a better room.
You will get to eat better food.

505
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,485
But Bunty will still
sleep in your pants.

506
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,526
- Bunty?
- You didn't get it?

507
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:25,235
Let me explain.

508
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:26,068
Look...

509
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:29,526
There are only two important
things in engineering life.

510
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:31,568
Brain and Bunty

511
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,901
There is a lot of greenery
available for the brain here

512
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,193
But for Bunty?

513
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,985
It's a drought prone area. A dry spell.

514
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:42,318
There are hardly any
girls in engineering colleges.

515
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,610
The boy girl ratio
of this place is 40:1.

516
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:50,568
For a simple girl,
there is cut-throat competition.

517
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:55,318
For a modern girl,
there is bleed-to-death competition.

518
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,235
It is quite tough.

519
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,526
And what about those
who look like models?

520
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,610
You have high expectations, huh?

521
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,526
This is an engineering college.

522
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:08,818
Girls who look like models
are like Hailey's comet.

523
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:10,943
They show up once every 76 years.

524
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,610
"A model, eh!"

525
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,693
No way!

526
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,985
Hailey's comet!

527
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,943
'That was the first time I saw Maya.'

528
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,735
"How am I feeling, won't you ask?"

529
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:39,568
"How am I doing, won't you ask?"

530
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,610
"How am I surviving without you?"

531
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:47,193
Don't even think about her, bro.

532
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,151
Why?

533
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:49,901
Look over there.

534
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:51,276
"Look at my heart..."

535
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,901
"And not my status"

536
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:58,526
"Each day without you..."

537
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,735
Look over there.

538
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:06,360
"I don't care about the consequences."

539
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:10,276
"You are meant to be mine."

540
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:12,151
- Hello.
- Hell no!

541
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,901
"No matter the distance between us."

542
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,610
Hi.

543
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,485
Go straight then right.

544
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,860
"How am I feeling, won't you ask?"

545
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:30,776
- Coffee?
- Forgive me?

546
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,276
"How am I doing, won't you ask?"

547
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,318
"How am I surviving without you?"

548
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,568
Look over there.

549
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:41,818
Unbearable, right?

550
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:44,818
Same here.

551
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,276
Look over there.

552
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:49,568
Anything else, ma'am?

553
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:53,985
She's still in demand.

554
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:57,610
Alright, guys.

555
00:39:58,318 --> 00:39:59,610
Time's up.

556
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:00,860
Let him rest.

557
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:03,610
Take rest, Kammo.

558
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,485
See you tomorrow.

559
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:16,891
How did it all happen?

560
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:20,100
You tried so hard to woo her...

561
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:22,975
...how could you let her go so easily?

562
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,891
Had it not been for Mummy and Acid, you
would have never even approached her.

563
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,725
Acid and Mummy.

564
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:44,016
Should we call them here?

565
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:45,558
You think they will come?

566
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,266
Even their dad will come!

567
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,350
Daddy!

568
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:53,975
You won't believe what Mummy's
father requested Acid and I to do.

569
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:55,350
You remember?

570
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:57,725
Excuse me?

571
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,266
- You guys are seniors?
- Yes.

572
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:03,266
He's my son, Sunder.

573
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,433
Uncle, he is your son?

574
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,141
- He has taken after his mother.
- Aah!

575
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,850
I have one request to make.

576
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:13,475
Don't worry uncle, we don't rag anyone.

577
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,725
But I want you to rag him!

578
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,266
- Mummy!
- You see that!

579
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,933
He keeps saying mummy, mummy.

580
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:23,641
He doesn't even wash his own underwear.

581
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:26,766
He weeps while watching chick flicks.

582
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:31,225
He has become a docile mamma's boy.

583
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:35,975
I want you to make a dude of him.

584
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:39,308
Don't worry, Papa.

585
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:40,683
Carry on, rest assured.

586
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:42,391
Thank you.

587
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:43,683
Papa!

588
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:47,516
Please come here.

589
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:49,516
Introduce yourself.

590
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:50,975
What's your name?

591
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,516
Are you deaf?
Stand straight!

592
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,183
What's your name?

593
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:56,516
Mummy!

594
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,350
- Mummy?
- Mummy?

595
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:02,058
- Mummy?
- Mummy?

596
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:03,766
'That's our Loser No. 2.'

597
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:05,350
'Mummy.'

598
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,433
Hey buddy!

599
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,058
Hi.

600
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:15,225
Anni and I were batchmates.

601
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,391
Hmm, he didn't have an accent back then.

602
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,850
Come on, I've been in
US for the last 20 years.

603
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:22,683
- What do you expect?
- You just wait.

604
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,308
Acid will be here soon.

605
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,058
He'll help you get rid of the accent.

606
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,891
Oh God!

607
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,391
Acid is bad news.

608
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,600
Do you know any cuss word?
On your mother?

609
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:34,433
Father?

610
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,975
Aunt? Uncle?
Sister? Anybody?

611
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,308
Do you know any cusses at all?

612
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,975
Use it on him.

613
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:48,266
You dog?

614
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:50,016
Sorry.

615
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:51,391
That's a cuss word?

616
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:53,683
Why don't you use silly
fellow and idiot too then?

617
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:55,141
- Silly fe...
- Shut it!

618
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,266
We get bad stock every year.

619
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,766
'Mummy was naive.'

620
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,975
- Then what do you know?
- 'Whereas Acid was an explosive!'

621
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:05,516
'A topper in school, Acid,
wasn't doing so well in engineering'

622
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,308
'The rage in him grew acidic'
'And thus he got the name, Acid'

623
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:10,766
'Our Loser No. 3.'

624
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,891
How are you, kiddo?

625
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,933
How are you doing, Mummy?

626
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,183
I heard you have an accent these days.

627
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,141
Acid and Sexa were after my life.

628
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,350
You piece of crap, you were a doll...

629
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:26,641
...we made a bull out of you.

630
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:29,516
His father had requested us to,
remember?

631
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:33,850
He was such a crybaby
when he first came to hostel.

632
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:36,225
"He was such a chomu (crybaby)"

633
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:41,516
You're trying to say you haven't
done anything but study all your life?

634
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,933
Tell me something.

635
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,433
Do you make yourself happy?

636
00:43:44,808 --> 00:43:46,058
What, sir?

637
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:50,266
Do you have a one-on-one
with your Bunty?

638
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:52,225
Sir, I don't know
have any Bunty.

639
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:53,683
Do you masturbate?

640
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,141
- No.
- Why?

641
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:58,891
Has your father locked it up for you?

642
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,391
It's a sin, sir.

643
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,933
A sin.

644
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Really?

645
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,558
That makes me the biggest sinner.

646
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:12,016
Bro, you are in a hostel
filled with sinners.

647
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:12,975
Do one thing.

648
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:16,016
Go to the girl's hostel and get
some of the girls' clothes from there.

649
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,558
I should steal them?

650
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:19,600
Men don't steal, crybaby.

651
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:21,183
They ask for it.

652
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:22,850
He is naive, sir.

653
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:23,975
He won't be able to do it.

654
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:25,100
Oh, I see.

655
00:44:25,558 --> 00:44:27,891
You are too smart, eh?
Come here.

656
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:29,475
You're a freshie, aren't you?

657
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,058
Now both of you will have to go there.

658
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:32,683
- No, sir. I don't even know him.
- Sorry, sir.

659
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:34,516
Are you going move
it or do I need to...?

660
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,016
You want to sit on a bottle?

661
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,350
Listen...

662
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,350
Try to get undies as well?

663
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:43,850
There's no harm in trying, bro.

664
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,016
Disgusting.

665
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,058
Can I say something?

666
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:50,350
When we're asking for their clothes,
I think you should do the talking.

667
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:54,058
This is the problem
with you small town boys.

668
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:55,933
You are scared to talk to girls.

669
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,850
But it is not your fault.

670
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,308
You must have hardly had any
interaction with them, right?

671
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,558
Breathe.

672
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:06,475
Watch and learn.

673
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:08,933
Be confident, bro.
Show confidence.

674
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:10,350
How?

675
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:13,266
Like this.

676
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,225
Excuse me.

677
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,683
Yes?

678
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:24,475
Hi.

679
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:27,641
Sorry?

680
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,975
Seniors?

681
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:32,975
- Excuse me?
- No, no, no.

682
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:35,100
What are you doing, bro?

683
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:42,141
Are you okay?

684
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,683
Our seniors have asked
us to get womens' clothes.

685
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:47,141
They'll beat us up
if we go empty handed.

686
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:49,183
Can you bring some girls'
clothes for us, please?

687
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:51,600
That's all?
Why is he so nervous?

688
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:53,308
Is this the first time
you are talking to a girl?

689
00:45:53,766 --> 00:45:56,350
He's from a small town.
As soon as he sees a girl he shits...

690
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:58,558
He gets nervous.
That's it.

691
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:02,433
- Right away.
- Make sure to get lots of them.

692
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:04,766
Confidence, eh?

693
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:06,600
Please don't tell anyone, bro.

694
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,933
I'll lose my reputation in the hostel.

695
00:46:10,475 --> 00:46:11,850
For a month, I'll do all...

696
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:13,100
For a month?

697
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:14,058
Stop it.

698
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:16,391
- It happened by mistake!
- On one condition.

699
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:17,350
What?

700
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,391
Sexa has asked for womens' undies too.

701
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:22,308
What do we do about that?

702
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:28,058
Why are you smiling?

703
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,350
This belongs to Maria Pinto.

704
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,225
And this belongs to Madhavi Tripathi.

705
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:37,141
Mummy...

706
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:39,975
you are a dark horse.

707
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:42,516
And sir,
this one is specially for you...

708
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,391
...with love, Dulari Pitroda.

709
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:47,183
I'll be damned.

710
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,225
Dulari wears mens' undergarments?

711
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:56,141
How would anyone know how she really is?

712
00:46:57,766 --> 00:46:59,308
How does it matter?

713
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,558
I haven't washed it in two days.

714
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:07,100
Smells amazing, doesn't it?
Those are Mummy's briefs.

715
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,433
You rascals!

716
00:47:10,308 --> 00:47:13,183
'Whenever I think about
those days I always feel...'

717
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:15,183
'Those were some of
the best days of my life.'

718
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:32,225
I present my smooth bottoms...

719
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:38,058
...to my seniors of H4...

720
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:39,766
We will live for H4.

721
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,516
We will live for H4.

722
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,475
And we will die for the girls at H10.

723
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:45,933
And we will die for the girls at H10.

724
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:51,641
Please don't mind,
I guess I got a little nervous that day.

725
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:52,766
A little?

726
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:55,850
But it was cute.

727
00:47:58,516 --> 00:47:59,391
Thank you.

728
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:16,225
"In an old album of memories,
lie hidden those days"

729
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:23,225
"Like a penny in a piggy-bank..."

730
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:27,725
"...those days stay treasured"

731
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:35,641
"With no destination to worry about..."

732
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:41,100
"We lived our lives to the fullest"

733
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:48,308
"Those days were all about treasuring
friendship and borrowing from friends"

734
00:48:48,516 --> 00:48:51,600
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

735
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:57,475
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

736
00:48:58,308 --> 00:48:59,350
Concentrate.

737
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:00,516
Hi.

738
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,475
The seniors have asked
me to have coffee with you.

739
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,641
They'll thrash me otherwise.

740
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:08,933
- I don't drink coffee.
- It's okay.

741
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,516
We can have tea instead.
No problem.

742
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:12,766
Two cups of tea! Special tea.

743
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:27,975
"We were pranksters"

744
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,141
He is coming! He is coming!

745
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:37,058
"We were devil's spawn"

746
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,641
"But brother..."

747
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:46,016
Bloody... Feel it.

748
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,266
Someone has abused you on your face.

749
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,433
How are you going to give
it back to him? With emotions

750
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:53,475
"Our friends were our souls"

751
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:54,266
Say it!

752
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,308
Hi.

753
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,266
"It was the day to lock
eyes with college girls."

754
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,308
What is it today?

755
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:03,475
Seniors have asked me
to watch a movie with you.

756
00:50:03,558 --> 00:50:06,058
And what if I say I am not in the mood?
Then?

757
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,558
Then they'll be in a bad mood.

758
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,766
This is what was
so different about Anni.

759
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:17,725
He never gave up on me.

760
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,891
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

761
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:24,683
Bro, go like a lover, not a beggar.

762
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:27,391
Wear this.

763
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,225
Much better.

764
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:37,683
Are you doing all of this to impress me?

765
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:42,266
If I knew how to impress you,
I would've already impressed you by now.

766
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:49,100
Raghav's condition isn't improving.

767
00:50:50,225 --> 00:50:52,141
But it's not deteriorating either.

768
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:53,766
Let's wait and watch.

769
00:50:56,225 --> 00:51:01,558
"We tried everything that was forbidden"

770
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,225
Who is he?

771
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,558
Everyone's unofficial daddy.

772
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:08,766
Derek.

773
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:24,016
"We did everything
that wasn't permitted"

774
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:25,725
Who was that?

775
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,850
I am not wearing anything.
Give me my clothes back!

776
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,516
Anni! Listen!

777
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:31,391
Anni!

778
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:33,141
Hi.

779
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,891
My seniors have sent me here today.

780
00:51:37,516 --> 00:51:43,308
"Those times were
driven by crazy antics."

781
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:49,391
"We crossed limits,
living life on the edge."

782
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:54,225
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

783
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:58,558
Rascal! Wait, you...!

784
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:05,975
"Those were times when birds
of the same feather flocked together."

785
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:07,225
I'm alive.

786
00:52:10,683 --> 00:52:20,391
"Those were times when our charged
up youth was discovering newer hues."

787
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:28,100
"We still remember old movie songs"

788
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:34,016
"of all the evergreen
and classic singers"

789
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,933
The world fears the
sharp edge of my sword.

790
00:52:37,016 --> 00:52:41,058
"which we played on keyboards
and guitar those days"

791
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,475
Sexa, you dropped your Bunty!

792
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,975
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

793
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:56,183
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

794
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:01,891
"Those were some of
the best days of my life"

795
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:04,225
Next.

796
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:06,641
Sunder Srivastava, All India Rank 92.

797
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,766
Forget his rank.
Does he play any sports?

798
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:10,558
Dramatics?

799
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:11,725
No.

800
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:12,850
Next.

801
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:16,141
Aniruddh Pathak, All India

802
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:17,558
Rank...
Did I ask for his rank?

803
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:21,975
State level basketball player.

804
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:24,141
He also plays cricket and football.

805
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:27,225
Which hostel is he from?

806
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:28,850
Losers.

807
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,016
Call him.

808
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,475
I'd like to meet him personally.

809
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:44,266
It's even better from inside.

810
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:46,308
Raggie.

811
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,225
You must be wondering when
the institute is the same...

812
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:51,683
...why is only H3 so swanky?

813
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:54,100
It's a world class institute.

814
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:56,600
Many foreign students
come here to study as well.

815
00:53:58,058 --> 00:54:00,766
If they make them stay in H4 then...

816
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,350
What kind of an
impression are we setting?

817
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,183
Tea?

818
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,975
We're the face of this institute.

819
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,308
And institute is bound
to keep its face swanky.

820
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,141
Great! Pack your bags and come tomorrow.

821
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:36,558
You are crazy.

822
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:39,600
Until yesterday,
you were dying to shift to H3.

823
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:41,016
What changed?

824
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:44,600
I don't know.
I don't feel like leaving H4.

825
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:47,100
Why are you overthinking it?

826
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,475
You have only spent two months in H4.

827
00:54:49,975 --> 00:54:51,641
I have only spent two
months with you as well.

828
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:54,641
Then why am I discussing
my problem with you?

829
00:54:57,308 --> 00:54:58,766
I have formed a bonding with these guys.

830
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:03,391
You know, whenever Mummy's
parents send some sweets...

831
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:04,475
...they are not only for him...

832
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:06,641
...they send some for all of us.

833
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:10,641
And when Acid gets overly frustrated...

834
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,350
...we tolerate his
cusses with a smile.

835
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:15,975
And irrespective of how Sexa behaves...

836
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:20,100
Even if you call him at 3 in the
morning, he will show up at your door.

837
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:24,766
What will you call this?

838
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:28,058
Family.

839
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:31,850
Exactly.

840
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:34,225
And no matter how your family is...

841
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:37,766
...you don't leave them, right?

842
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:52,058
People are dying to join H3

843
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,766
...and you are bluntly
refusing the offer?

844
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:57,391
Where did you get that audacity from,
bloody freshie!

845
00:55:58,141 --> 00:55:59,766
- Look, I am really sorry but...
- Sorry?

846
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,475
You will feel sorry for yourself,
every year,

847
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:05,891
Just like Derek.

848
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:07,850
He had the same attitude.

849
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:10,266
He would have lived like a winner in H3.

850
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:14,225
But he is instead rotting
in H4 since 3 years, like a loser.

851
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:19,141
You will rot too.

852
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:20,558
Get lost!

853
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,683
Didn't you hear him?
Leave!

854
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,350
Who are you staring at?

855
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:29,433
Move it!

856
00:56:49,933 --> 00:56:51,641
- Excuse me?
- Yes, sir?

857
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:54,141
I'm looking for Aniruddh Pathak.

858
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,766
He's in the mess.

859
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:08,266
All the losers, under one roof?

860
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:10,975
Hey Baldie, who are you calling a loser?

861
00:57:11,266 --> 00:57:15,391
Hey fatso,
who are you even calling a baldie?

862
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:18,308
Derek?

863
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,766
Wow!

864
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,391
How are you?

865
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,141
Do you drink after dinner?

866
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:36,766
I can also drink before
and while having my dinner.

867
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:40,350
'That's Derek.'

868
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:42,683
'The biggest loser of the hostel.'

869
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,391
'And our unofficial daddy.'

870
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,141
60ml vodka.

871
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:50,350
40ml orange juice.

872
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:55,558
And 20ml soda.

873
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:00,558
What's this?

874
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:03,475
Not everyone is fortunate to get this.

875
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:06,183
Derek special.

876
00:58:08,808 --> 00:58:10,308
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

877
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:12,100
But why here?

878
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:14,266
Where else can we find ice at this hour?

879
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:19,891
That's liquid nitrogen.

880
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:21,766
Ice is over there.

881
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:29,975
Sir, this is ice for sure, right?

882
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:31,975
You're doubting Edison regarding bulbs?

883
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:33,225
No.

884
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:46,058
Sir, Raggie said you
too were offered to join H3.

885
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:48,225
Raggie is a dog.

886
00:58:49,016 --> 00:58:51,433
He shifts good athletes
from other hostels to H3.

887
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,558
And takes the credit of winning GC.

888
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,641
GC?

889
00:58:57,766 --> 00:58:59,266
General Championship.

890
00:59:00,516 --> 00:59:01,516
Sports.

891
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:04,183
They have sport events
in this institute?

892
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:09,558
You thought we only
study in this institute?

893
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:13,850
And that we are called losers because...

894
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:16,475
...our rooms are small
and our mess is disgusting?

895
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,225
GC is that important?

896
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:20,308
Important?

897
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,975
If it wasn't important...

898
00:59:23,058 --> 00:59:26,141
...then 10 hostels wouldn't
compete in 30 sports for 2 months.

899
00:59:33,975 --> 00:59:35,100
If it wasn't important...

900
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:37,516
...then everyone's pride
and our reputation...

901
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:39,850
...wouldn't be at stake every year.

902
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:45,016
Losers! Losers! Losers!

903
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:47,850
We are that bad?

904
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,516
Swig it.

905
00:59:56,975 --> 01:00:00,016
You're telling me that in the past
15 years we have not won GC even once?

906
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:02,516
Forget winning...

907
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,766
...we rank last every year.

908
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:07,433
Now do you get it?

909
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:13,183
So we won't be called
losers if we win GC?

910
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:14,641
Don't even think about it.

911
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:17,058
- Why?
- I tried for three years.

912
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:19,391
This is your last year.

913
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,225
How about one last attempt?

914
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:23,850
Drop it.

915
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:26,933
There is no way we can do it.

916
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:28,808
We can't if we don't try.

917
01:00:29,516 --> 01:00:32,433
It hurts you more
because you are new here.

918
01:00:32,725 --> 01:00:34,350
Wait for a year or two...

919
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:37,641
...it'll stop hurting.

920
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:38,891
Hey losers!

921
01:00:39,308 --> 01:00:41,850
Do you only plan on staring at the board
Or ever aim to feature on it?

922
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:44,100
Your dad is a loser.

923
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:46,016
I dare you to come
and say it to me on my face.

924
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:54,933
Whether you agree or not,
it still hurts you.

925
01:00:57,225 --> 01:01:00,933
I seriously thought about
what Anni said for two days.

926
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,850
'Then I thought,
if I don't do anything this year...'

927
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,141
'...then this will pinch
me for the rest of my life.'

928
01:01:12,058 --> 01:01:17,225
Many of you wanted to leave
H4 but you didn't get an opportunity to.

929
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:20,308
Now we have two options with us.

930
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,725
We either live with this losers' tag.

931
01:01:24,558 --> 01:01:27,225
Or we try to get rid of it.

932
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:33,641
If there is anyone here who
can live with this losers' tag...

933
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,141
...he can leave.

934
01:01:36,766 --> 01:01:38,183
Trust me.

935
01:01:39,016 --> 01:01:40,558
No one will question you.

936
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,933
I speak from experience here.

937
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,933
In the campus,
this losers' tag hurts a lot.

938
01:01:58,766 --> 01:02:01,516
But there's something
which hurts even more.

939
01:02:01,975 --> 01:02:05,516
The fact that we don't even try
doing anything to get rid of the tag.

940
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:10,266
Now the question is, do we
want to get rid of this 'loser' tag?

941
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,683
Yes!

942
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:14,850
Can we get rid of this 'loser' tag?

943
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:16,058
Yes!

944
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,933
Can we win this year's GC?

945
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:20,016
Yes.

946
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:24,558
How the hell will we lose this losers'
tag if we don't win this year's GC?

947
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:27,683
Can we win this year's GC?

948
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:28,933
Yes.

949
01:02:31,058 --> 01:02:34,933
Whoever says yes will get
a milkshake from Derek's account.

950
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,683
So now, can we win this year's GC?

951
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:38,600
Yes.

952
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:39,683
Simple.

953
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:45,725
As soon as mid-semesters got over,
GC's selection began.

954
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,975
'We were expecting this year's
freshies to have at least some talent.'

955
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:55,350
You told us you played table-tennis?

956
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:58,350
I do, at home, on the dining table.

957
01:02:58,433 --> 01:02:59,350
With my little sister.

958
01:02:59,433 --> 01:03:01,266
Who used to win, you or your sister?

959
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,975
His style looks promising.

960
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:06,266
Amazing.

961
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,933
Are you bowling or throwing a bomb?

962
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:17,975
Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

963
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:18,933
Time out.

964
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,891
You! Get out of there.

965
01:03:26,016 --> 01:03:29,016
Sir, I won't give
up until my last breath.

966
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,016
You are already on
your second last breath.

967
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,016
Leave! Leave!

968
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:34,683
Who brought this 'huff puff' here?

969
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,558
How is it going?

970
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:38,391
He's a mermaid, bro.

971
01:03:38,475 --> 01:03:40,433
He's been underwater for 30 seconds now.

972
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:48,391
Guys, if he dies,
we're bound to be jailed.

973
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:49,766
Yuck!

974
01:03:50,016 --> 01:03:51,475
It would have been
better had he died.

975
01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:56,766
'By the time selections
got over we had realised...'

976
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,225
'...that our current position
in GC wasn't looking any good.'

977
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:01,641
Oh come on, Derek!

978
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:07,266
Losers are trying to be choosers?

979
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:18,808
It is not going as we had expected.

980
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:21,975
Raghav seems to be responding...

981
01:04:23,433 --> 01:04:24,641
...but according to the scans...

982
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,475
...the swelling in his
brain is slowly increasing.

983
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:30,600
I'm a bit worried.

984
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:33,058
What do we do now, sir?

985
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,183
We will try our best.

986
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,058
What else can we do?

987
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,558
What do we do now?

988
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:43,350
We will try our best.

989
01:04:44,183 --> 01:04:45,516
What else can we do?

990
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:57,043
That's like the Clinton...

991
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:59,502
Mumbai's so expensive!

992
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:02,835
I have gone broke.

993
01:05:02,918 --> 01:05:04,918
You went shopping?

994
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,918
I didn't know I'd be
staying here for this long.

995
01:05:09,293 --> 01:05:10,502
He's bought undies!

996
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:14,752
I don't know about you guys,
but I change them every day.

997
01:05:14,835 --> 01:05:16,043
That's an improvement, Sexa.

998
01:05:16,168 --> 01:05:17,793
You used to change
them every hour back then.

999
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,043
Age has taken toll on Bunty as well.

1000
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:21,793
He needs to rest too.

1001
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,835
But why did you need to buy them?

1002
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:25,418
You could have borrowed it from him.

1003
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:27,293
You are used to sniffing his briefs.

1004
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:32,335
Hi, guys.

1005
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:34,502
What's going on?

1006
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:41,543
What did the doctor say?

1007
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:45,252
He said the swelling in
Raghav's brain is increasing.

1008
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:47,043
If they aren't able to
control it with medications...

1009
01:05:47,168 --> 01:05:48,835
...then surgery is the only option.

1010
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:53,668
Don't worry, guys.

1011
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:56,502
Maya and I will manage.

1012
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:59,627
I cannot expect you to just
ignore your work and stay here.

1013
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:00,918
Yeah?

1014
01:06:02,543 --> 01:06:03,793
You guys carry on.

1015
01:06:12,377 --> 01:06:14,502
Work a vicious beast, isn't it?

1016
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:17,335
When work needs us...

1017
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:20,877
...our family adjusts, doesn't it?

1018
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,460
Now when our family needs us...

1019
01:06:24,335 --> 01:06:26,502
...then work will have to adjust.

1020
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:27,918
Hey...

1021
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:31,293
I'm staying back, okay?

1022
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,585
Me too.

1023
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:35,543
No one's leaving.

1024
01:06:35,752 --> 01:06:37,293
Anni, we are all going to stay.

1025
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:40,293
Great, guys.

1026
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,043
Dinner is ready if you guys are hungry.

1027
01:06:50,002 --> 01:06:52,002
- Thank you, bro.
- Please.

1028
01:06:52,668 --> 01:06:54,127
You had started the story...

1029
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:57,377
...and we will all end it together.

1030
01:06:58,543 --> 01:07:01,085
But you won't be able
to end it without me.

1031
01:07:01,252 --> 01:07:03,252
Bevda (Boozer), you?

1032
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:05,252
Bevda!

1033
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:06,960
How are you?

1034
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:08,127
Good.

1035
01:07:09,752 --> 01:07:11,002
Good that you came.

1036
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,168
We had almost removed
you from the story.

1037
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,002
'That's Bevda, our super senior.'

1038
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:21,585
'And our Loser No. 5.'

1039
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:25,210
I don't need to tell you
why they call me Bevda.

1040
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:28,502
He would open more alcohol
bottles than books in his room.

1041
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,002
Today... quantum physics.

1042
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:35,710
Quantum physics.

1043
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:37,293
Here, have it.

1044
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:38,002
Cheers.

1045
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,627
'Bevda was the
one to train us in drinking.'

1046
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:43,252
'Train.'

1047
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:44,793
That reminds me...

1048
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:46,710
No, not the train story, guys.

1049
01:07:46,793 --> 01:07:47,918
You have to hear this story.

1050
01:07:48,002 --> 01:07:48,918
Let's get back to GC, guys.

1051
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:50,335
We'll get back to GC...

1052
01:07:50,418 --> 01:07:51,960
...but after stop at this station.

1053
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:53,835
So what happened was...

1054
01:07:53,918 --> 01:07:56,752
'He was returning after spending
the summer vacation at home.'

1055
01:07:56,918 --> 01:07:57,918
'It was a long journey.'

1056
01:07:58,002 --> 01:07:59,918
'Now you cannot expect him
to endure such a long dry spell.'

1057
01:08:00,002 --> 01:08:03,418
'So he was enjoying
vodka in a bottle of water.'

1058
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:05,043
I want water.

1059
01:08:05,627 --> 01:08:08,002
Brother, can we have some water?

1060
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:10,043
We have run out of it.
My son's thirsty.

1061
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:13,127
'But how could Bevda
offer vodka to that kid?'

1062
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:14,918
But I already drank from it.

1063
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:16,127
It's okay.

1064
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,377
I cannot give it.

1065
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:21,293
He's such a wretch.

1066
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:27,585
After that,
the couple started giving him an earful.

1067
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:29,335
We are just asking you for water.

1068
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:30,918
That too for a kid. It's not
like I'm asking for some for myself.

1069
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:32,835
Don't you have any sense, you dog!

1070
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:33,835
Give it to him, brother.

1071
01:08:33,918 --> 01:08:35,668
You will do a good
deed by giving him water.

1072
01:08:35,752 --> 01:08:37,085
Otherwise, you will rot in hell.

1073
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:38,668
He's a nasty man, drop it.

1074
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:40,918
He's such a douche!

1075
01:08:41,002 --> 01:08:42,835
- Why are you staring at me?
- He is!

1076
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,460
Don't waste your breath on him.

1077
01:08:44,918 --> 01:08:47,335
We are only asking for water!
Is that water infused with gold?

1078
01:08:47,418 --> 01:08:49,543
You deserved to be punished
and killed to death.

1079
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:52,377
You dumbhead.
You are okay peeing 10 times?

1080
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,585
Wait, I will beat you up,
once you get down in Mumbai.

1081
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:56,918
If I beat you,
then you will die on the spot.

1082
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:04,252
Even Acid doesn't cuss so harshly.

1083
01:09:04,494 --> 01:09:07,460
Anyway, if you are done pulling
my leg, can we concentrate on GC now?

1084
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:09,418
Yes.

1085
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:10,668
GC.

1086
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:15,585
'And once again, we
got fused bulbs for players.'

1087
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:16,710
Check.

1088
01:09:16,793 --> 01:09:19,127
'There were only a handful who had still
kept our hopes alive with their talent.'

1089
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:22,127
'Bevda was the current
chess champion of the institute.'

1090
01:09:22,627 --> 01:09:26,127
'Anni was good at football,
basketball and cricket.'

1091
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,168
Shot.

1092
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:31,877
'And Derek was god when it came to
weight lifting, football and athletics.'

1093
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,127
Your Queen is trapped.

1094
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:36,210
How do you plan to get her out?

1095
01:09:36,293 --> 01:09:38,877
'And the one we thought
was a damsel in distress...'

1096
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:42,252
That was a fluke shot.
I dare to take you this black coin.

1097
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,210
'...was actually a prince of thieves.'

1098
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:50,335
Oh Mummy...

1099
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:52,293
You are going to kill it there!

1100
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:56,002
In spite of all this,
GC was still out of our reach.

1101
01:09:57,418 --> 01:09:58,918
I wish you all the best, guys!

1102
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:00,377
'GC started.'

1103
01:10:00,835 --> 01:10:03,835
'As usual,
H3 had started bagging all the points.'

1104
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:11,752
'And we had started giving it
to them on a silver platter.'

1105
01:10:20,168 --> 01:10:21,460
H4, the losers!

1106
01:10:21,835 --> 01:10:25,418
Derek! You have already
wasted three years.

1107
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:27,502
Why are you wasting their time now?

1108
01:10:27,918 --> 01:10:29,627
You are anyway not going
to accomplish anything in GC.

1109
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,918
GC isn't over as yet.

1110
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,918
Hey, you can talk!

1111
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,085
I thought you could only
wag your tail and follow Derek.

1112
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:41,502
We'll defeat you so badly this year...

1113
01:10:42,002 --> 01:10:45,168
...that you will run with a
tail between your legs next year.

1114
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:46,710
You English Dog!

1115
01:10:47,002 --> 01:10:48,585
Stay in your limits, okay?

1116
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:51,002
You bloody loser,
you will show me my limits, huh?

1117
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:52,335
You...

1118
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:55,335
Acid, relax, man.
He's a dog.

1119
01:10:57,835 --> 01:10:58,918
Let him bark.

1120
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:00,252
Yes, I bark.

1121
01:11:01,043 --> 01:11:04,168
But the day I bite,
there will be no respite.

1122
01:11:04,377 --> 01:11:06,002
Buzz off. Shoo.

1123
01:11:07,168 --> 01:11:08,043
What?

1124
01:11:08,418 --> 01:11:09,502
Go lick him.

1125
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:20,115
Anni...

1126
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,460
- It's just sports, man.
- No, it is not.

1127
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,793
This isn't just sports for us.

1128
01:11:26,918 --> 01:11:28,418
Our hostel's reputation is at stake.

1129
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:30,418
We've come here to study.

1130
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:32,377
Why are you getting
so serious about sports?

1131
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,252
We are here only for four years.

1132
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:36,377
You can say that because you
aren't the one with the losers' tag.

1133
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,793
And anyway, it's not like
you will ever get a losers' tag...

1134
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,127
...because you are too
scared to even participate.

1135
01:11:42,293 --> 01:11:43,710
What have you even
gained by participating?

1136
01:11:43,793 --> 01:11:46,002
- The losers' tag, right?
- I can tolerate it.

1137
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:47,627
It is far better than
being called a coward.

1138
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,668
That one must not participate because
we are going to lose anyway.

1139
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:53,043
- Now you are getting personal.
- No.

1140
01:11:53,502 --> 01:11:55,377
- You are getting personal, Maya.
- Then go.

1141
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:57,210
- Why do you come here to talk to me?
- I am going.

1142
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:58,627
It's not like I enjoy sitting here.

1143
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,460
I might as well think about GC instead.

1144
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,585
I'm just wasting my time here.

1145
01:12:04,377 --> 01:12:05,668
Go to hell, Anni.

1146
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,460
And yes, we aren't cowards.

1147
01:12:08,877 --> 01:12:10,002
"We aren't cowards!"

1148
01:12:26,668 --> 01:12:27,918
I spoke to mom.

1149
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:29,418
She said it's all okay.

1150
01:12:29,502 --> 01:12:31,752
And she is sending
sweets to cheer us up.

1151
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,002
How sweet.

1152
01:12:34,335 --> 01:12:36,043
- Made out of gram flour?
- My favourite.

1153
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,835
Such guys will help us win GC?

1154
01:12:38,002 --> 01:12:40,918
We are in such a mess
and he wants to eat sweets!

1155
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,460
- Leave it.
- Shut it.

1156
01:12:42,543 --> 01:12:44,043
Because you have nothing better to do.

1157
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:47,793
And you, while I am participating
in GC once again because of you...

1158
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:49,752
Your focus is more
on that girl of yours.

1159
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:51,293
Why are you venting your anger on us?

1160
01:12:51,377 --> 01:12:53,085
- Zip it, Acid.
- Boys are trying.

1161
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,335
- Zip it, Acid.
- Listen...

1162
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:55,335
Why are you getting hyper?

1163
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,710
It's not like you are
holding any victory flags here.

1164
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:57,793
Don't you dare mess with me.

1165
01:12:57,877 --> 01:12:59,335
- I've anyway lost it.
- You've been lashing out on us...

1166
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:00,377
He's talking nonsense.

1167
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,210
Bro! Bro!
Sit down.

1168
01:13:02,293 --> 01:13:04,168
- He has been lecturing us.
- One second.

1169
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:07,168
Blaming each other like
this won't help us, guys.

1170
01:13:07,418 --> 01:13:09,585
We are losing because we
are only feeling bad about losing.

1171
01:13:09,668 --> 01:13:10,793
We aren't terrified of losing.

1172
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:13,627
The day we start getting
terrified of losing...

1173
01:13:13,752 --> 01:13:15,668
...we will start finding
the path to victory.

1174
01:13:15,793 --> 01:13:16,918
What are you saying, Anni?

1175
01:13:17,043 --> 01:13:18,793
Our hostel's reputation
is at stake, right?

1176
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:21,418
So then we too should
put something at stake.

1177
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:24,918
Something that we're
frightened to let go of.

1178
01:13:26,543 --> 01:13:27,335
What do you guys say?

1179
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:37,918
Nobody wants to win!

1180
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:44,210
Okay.

1181
01:13:45,085 --> 01:13:47,877
Till we don't win GC...

1182
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,918
...I won't talk to my mother.

1183
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,918
Till we don't win GC...

1184
01:13:58,585 --> 01:13:59,835
No smoking.

1185
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:03,043
Acid?

1186
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,293
What the hell!

1187
01:14:07,835 --> 01:14:08,752
No cussing.

1188
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:11,793
Bevda?

1189
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:13,752
No drinking.

1190
01:14:16,043 --> 01:14:17,043
Sexa?

1191
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:19,460
No TV.

1192
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:21,918
Okay.

1193
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:26,418
No playing with Bunty.

1194
01:14:29,502 --> 01:14:30,293
You?

1195
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,335
No more conversations with Maya.

1196
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:39,835
We had all taken the pledge to win GC.

1197
01:14:40,252 --> 01:14:43,335
Then, that pledge started
taking toil on us.

1198
01:14:43,543 --> 01:14:44,793
I swear.

1199
01:15:19,127 --> 01:15:20,877
Practice.
You can do it with practice, hmm?

1200
01:15:21,502 --> 01:15:22,418
You can do it.

1201
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:26,502
"Getting defeated by the opposition?"

1202
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:30,460
"That's the worst kind of humiliation."

1203
01:15:30,877 --> 01:15:38,710
"Don't come back home as losers,
that's our family's expectation."

1204
01:15:38,793 --> 01:15:40,835
Mamma's... boy.

1205
01:15:41,127 --> 01:15:42,835
Mother... board.

1206
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:46,585
Take them or else we will
end up breaking our pledge.

1207
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:54,835
"We sir, are incapacitated
and in a helpless situation."

1208
01:15:55,168 --> 01:15:57,835
"This is a struggle..."

1209
01:15:57,918 --> 01:15:58,877
Hi.

1210
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:00,793
"How will we get salvation?"

1211
01:16:00,877 --> 01:16:02,793
Oh, come on!
That's enough.

1212
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,335
"Wake up your inner strength..."

1213
01:16:11,418 --> 01:16:15,252
"Be strong, it's time for a revolution."

1214
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:19,502
"Wake up your inner strength..."

1215
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:23,502
"Be strong, it's time for a revolution."

1216
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:27,918
"From today this will
be our one and only goal."

1217
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,918
Is this how you defend?
You mother...

1218
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:32,252
"Control."

1219
01:16:35,085 --> 01:16:36,210
"Control."

1220
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,335
"Control."

1221
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:44,418
"Control."

1222
01:16:47,793 --> 01:16:50,918
"We will keep all emotions..."

1223
01:16:51,002 --> 01:16:52,127
It's your mother.

1224
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:55,835
"...and feelings at bay..."

1225
01:16:56,293 --> 01:17:03,252
"...till we don't have a
score we are proud of every day."

1226
01:17:03,335 --> 01:17:04,293
"Right."

1227
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:12,293
"We will awaken our inner saint."

1228
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:20,627
"My friends,
we will concentrate and meditate."

1229
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:28,752
"If we don't concentrate,
we are going to fail."

1230
01:17:28,835 --> 01:17:33,335
"Our honour is precious.
To keep it safe is our goal."

1231
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,460
"Control."

1232
01:17:38,793 --> 01:17:40,085
You call this a curry, you...

1233
01:17:40,168 --> 01:17:41,293
"Control."

1234
01:17:44,168 --> 01:17:45,377
"Control."

1235
01:17:46,043 --> 01:17:49,085
You are neither calling
us nor taking our calls.

1236
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:53,627
"Control."

1237
01:17:56,418 --> 01:17:57,668
- Papa...
- Enough.

1238
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:10,418
You have over-delivered on your promise.

1239
01:18:10,877 --> 01:18:12,835
But still, thank you.
Thank you.

1240
01:18:20,043 --> 01:18:21,418
How is he playing?

1241
01:18:25,335 --> 01:18:27,002
What did we gain by taking the pledge?

1242
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,127
You? Were you starving during the match?

1243
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,418
- What?
- You had four goals.

1244
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:33,585
How, bro?

1245
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,543
And he? While we all were watching
the game off the field...

1246
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:39,085
...one guy was just watching
the match while being on the field.

1247
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:40,585
This idiot!

1248
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:42,752
And you?

1249
01:18:42,835 --> 01:18:45,627
There are three toilets
if you go through this corridor.

1250
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,002
Go and shit there.

1251
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:49,293
Why were you taking
dump on the ping-pong table?

1252
01:18:49,377 --> 01:18:51,252
Hey, stop lecturing.

1253
01:18:51,877 --> 01:18:53,460
You are not even playing.

1254
01:18:55,793 --> 01:18:57,752
But I'm still at the
receiving end of it, right?

1255
01:18:58,377 --> 01:18:59,585
Anni, Derek

1256
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,668
My Bunty won't be able
to take so much load.

1257
01:19:09,002 --> 01:19:09,918
Guys...

1258
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:11,585
Bevda...

1259
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:23,002
Hold him tight.

1260
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:28,668
What did we gain from the pledge?

1261
01:19:29,877 --> 01:19:31,668
It isn't like we're
winning any matches either.

1262
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:35,085
We were anyway suffering
a defeat in GC...

1263
01:19:35,585 --> 01:19:37,460
...we've ended up making
our friend suffer as well.

1264
01:19:40,168 --> 01:19:41,335
Is it really worth it?

1265
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,335
I don't know.

1266
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,627
I am sorry, bro.

1267
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:54,460
You had to face so many
problems because of us.

1268
01:19:55,543 --> 01:19:57,752
Stop this.

1269
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,252
You can break the pledge.
We won't blame you for it.

1270
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:01,335
I swear.

1271
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,877
That day when everyone
was taking a pledge...

1272
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,252
... I took one too.

1273
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:12,710
I thought I would drink in my room.

1274
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,502
No one would know.

1275
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:18,835
But I couldn't do it.

1276
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:22,502
I have tried to quit
drinking so many times.

1277
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,085
Even you know.

1278
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,793
For my mother.

1279
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:28,127
For my father.

1280
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:31,710
For my one-sided girlfriend.

1281
01:20:32,877 --> 01:20:37,043
No, I had actually started
drinking because of her.

1282
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:40,335
But I couldn't do it.

1283
01:20:43,918 --> 01:20:46,335
For the first time, I actually
feel like I might be able to do it.

1284
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:50,918
That too for you losers.

1285
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:53,418
Do you know why?

1286
01:20:53,793 --> 01:20:56,918
Because you all have taught
me, more than...

1287
01:20:57,377 --> 01:21:00,668
...being called a loser
after losing to someone...

1288
01:21:01,543 --> 01:21:04,085
...it is worse to be called a loser
after losing to your own self.

1289
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:07,918
This time it's do or die.

1290
01:21:11,293 --> 01:21:12,502
Do or die.

1291
01:21:15,668 --> 01:21:18,460
Raghav's reports aren't
very encouraging, Mr. Pathak.

1292
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:35,210
'Our situation in GC
was not quite encouraging.'

1293
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:38,752
'But we weren't those
who accepted defeat easily.'

1294
01:21:42,543 --> 01:21:43,918
Team meeting, right now.

1295
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:49,502
H3's hen has 2 Golds,
2 Silvers and 1 Bronze...

1296
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,835
...scoring 17 points.

1297
01:21:53,043 --> 01:21:58,168
And our rooster,
as always is laying eggs at zero.

1298
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:01,460
Now the question is,
how can our rooster chase their hen...

1299
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:03,460
...because we aren't talented enough.

1300
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,877
That means our rooster remains a virgin,
just like us.

1301
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,168
No.

1302
01:22:07,668 --> 01:22:10,710
If we use some tricks our
rooster can still go after their hen.

1303
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:12,210
Be clear.

1304
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:18,002
Trick No 1.

1305
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,502
Pressure cooker.

1306
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:23,335
Put so much pressure
on the opponent's team...

1307
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:24,835
...that they blow their own whistle.

1308
01:22:25,168 --> 01:22:25,918
How?

1309
01:22:26,377 --> 01:22:27,293
I'll explain.

1310
01:22:27,585 --> 01:22:28,627
It won't go in.

1311
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,877
Keep playing. Concentrate.

1312
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:34,002
I'm telling you it won't go in.
His hands are shivering.

1313
01:22:34,085 --> 01:22:35,085
He is scared.

1314
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:36,127
He's under pressure.

1315
01:22:36,293 --> 01:22:38,085
Hit it, why are you staring at me?
Hit it, stupid.

1316
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:39,085
He's scared.

1317
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:40,752
His hands are shivering.
He's nervous.

1318
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:41,752
It won't go in.

1319
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:46,168
And it didn't.

1320
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:49,752
It's that simple.

1321
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:53,085
When one person can
put so much pressure...

1322
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:57,168
...then imagine what 25-50
such scoundrels can do.

1323
01:22:57,377 --> 01:23:00,043
We cannot even find decent
players to participate in GC.

1324
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:02,418
From where will you
get so many people to cheer?

1325
01:23:02,752 --> 01:23:09,668
Bro, when they will get free milkshake
from the Sports Secretary's account...

1326
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,335
...forget cheering they will
even be willing to murder anyone.

1327
01:23:12,418 --> 01:23:13,418
I am telling you.

1328
01:23:14,918 --> 01:23:16,043
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

1329
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:18,293
A milkshake free for
every match's cheering.

1330
01:23:18,377 --> 01:23:19,835
Chocolate, strawberry, butterscotch.

1331
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:22,460
You can take whichever you want.

1332
01:23:22,543 --> 01:23:24,335
Our army is getting ready.

1333
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:26,335
Arms and ammunition are ready as well.

1334
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,835
Acid, are you done with the slogan?

1335
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:30,710
Awesome.

1336
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:32,002
Go for it.

1337
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,418
Other hostels will be
petrified when they hear it.

1338
01:23:35,918 --> 01:23:36,710
Boys!

1339
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,127
Oh!

1340
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:40,793
East or west H4 is the best!

1341
01:23:40,877 --> 01:23:42,835
- East or west...
- H4 is the best!

1342
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:45,293
- North or south...
- Go shut your mouth!

1343
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:50,627
There is one more.

1344
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,918
It's better than the last one.

1345
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:53,418
One, two, three, four!

1346
01:23:53,502 --> 01:23:54,918
H4! H4!

1347
01:23:55,002 --> 01:23:56,502
One, two, three...

1348
01:23:56,627 --> 01:23:58,460
H4, H4...

1349
01:23:58,543 --> 01:23:59,543
Four.

1350
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,543
I too have one.

1351
01:24:02,627 --> 01:24:04,918
Helpless your slogan has made us.

1352
01:24:05,002 --> 01:24:06,877
Even God can't save us.

1353
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:09,418
I just made it up.
And it's better than yours.

1354
01:24:09,668 --> 01:24:13,793
We gave you one whole day
and you serve us decorated bullshit?

1355
01:24:13,877 --> 01:24:15,835
- You...
- Relax. Have a seat.

1356
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,877
Bro, we asked for a slogan, not a hymn.

1357
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,252
What are you doing, man?

1358
01:24:23,085 --> 01:24:25,835
I can't get the right
emotions out without cussing.

1359
01:24:25,918 --> 01:24:27,835
There is acid running
through your veins, man.

1360
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:30,710
We need it.
Pour it all out on the paper.

1361
01:24:30,793 --> 01:24:34,918
Listen, think about all
the professors who criticised you.

1362
01:24:36,127 --> 01:24:36,918
Give it a try.

1363
01:24:37,002 --> 01:24:37,835
How many times do you plan to fail?

1364
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:38,793
Just get out from here.

1365
01:24:38,877 --> 01:24:40,460
You have no future.

1366
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:42,877
Mummy!

1367
01:24:43,835 --> 01:24:46,127
I need Professor Ramanathan's face.

1368
01:24:46,418 --> 01:24:47,168
Yes!

1369
01:24:47,252 --> 01:24:50,793
Acid, you are a failure.

1370
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,127
You will always rank last.

1371
01:24:53,293 --> 01:24:55,668
You wanna to mess with me, eh?

1372
01:24:56,752 --> 01:24:57,668
Yes!

1373
01:25:02,127 --> 01:25:05,127
Bro, this Acid will create
a hole even in titanium.

1374
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:07,210
We need few more like these, please.

1375
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:08,127
Thank you.

1376
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:09,377
- Mummy?
- Yes?

1377
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,460
Everyone's faces.

1378
01:25:19,752 --> 01:25:21,543
Hold him tight!

1379
01:25:21,627 --> 01:25:22,418
Oh yeah!

1380
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:24,293
- Use your might!
- Oh yeah!

1381
01:25:24,377 --> 01:25:26,043
- Serve him right!
- Oh yeah!

1382
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:27,793
- Now we fight!
- Oh yeah!

1383
01:25:27,877 --> 01:25:29,627
Bloody Coward.

1384
01:25:35,543 --> 01:25:36,585
Ready?

1385
01:25:37,335 --> 01:25:39,377
I was asking the moon...

1386
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,793
Have you ever seen...

1387
01:25:40,877 --> 01:25:42,793
Such a goof anywhere?

1388
01:25:42,877 --> 01:25:46,502
The moon swears on his mother...

1389
01:25:46,585 --> 01:25:49,085
No! No! No!

1390
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:52,502
Johnny! Johnny!

1391
01:25:52,585 --> 01:25:53,835
Yes, papa?

1392
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:56,085
- Have you pooped?
- No, papa.

1393
01:25:56,168 --> 01:25:57,418
Telling lies?

1394
01:25:57,502 --> 01:25:58,710
No, papa.

1395
01:25:58,793 --> 01:25:59,918
Open your undies!

1396
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:01,627
Ha, ha, ha.

1397
01:26:03,793 --> 01:26:05,585
- Hold him tight!
- Oh yeah!

1398
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:07,127
- Use your might!
- Oh yeah!

1399
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,043
I was asking the moon...

1400
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:10,543
Have you ever seen...

1401
01:26:10,627 --> 01:26:12,418
Such a goof anywhere?

1402
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:14,168
- Hold him tight!
- Oh yeah!

1403
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:16,210
Bloody coward!

1404
01:26:16,293 --> 01:26:18,918
No! No! No!

1405
01:26:19,335 --> 01:26:20,710
Open your undies!

1406
01:26:20,793 --> 01:26:21,627
Ha, ha, ha.

1407
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:22,752
Open your undies!

1408
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:23,877
Ha, ha, ha.

1409
01:26:24,002 --> 01:26:25,002
Open your undies!

1410
01:26:25,085 --> 01:26:26,210
Ha, ha, ha.

1411
01:26:26,335 --> 01:26:27,335
Open your undies!

1412
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:28,627
Ha, ha, ha!

1413
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:36,413
Congrats, boys.

1414
01:26:39,121 --> 01:26:40,246
Congrats, Anni.

1415
01:26:42,913 --> 01:26:43,746
Anni?

1416
01:26:47,663 --> 01:26:48,996
What went so wrong?

1417
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:53,829
If I wanted,
I could have ruined it for Anni.

1418
01:26:58,871 --> 01:26:59,996
Don't worry, Maya.

1419
01:27:00,829 --> 01:27:02,163
I am here for you.

1420
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:06,079
Then Maya would have been mine,
and you too.

1421
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:07,621
Right, sure.

1422
01:27:07,704 --> 01:27:10,121
But alas, I have a heart of gold.

1423
01:27:10,746 --> 01:27:12,538
After all, I am from Delhi.

1424
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:18,038
And because of this
pledge of ours Anni...

1425
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:21,371
...had to put something
he loved the most at stake.

1426
01:27:23,413 --> 01:27:24,371
You, Maya.

1427
01:27:58,329 --> 01:28:04,829
"We need to keep this distance for now."

1428
01:28:06,913 --> 01:28:08,829
We don't only benefit
from the games we win...

1429
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:10,371
...but also when H3 loses.

1430
01:28:10,788 --> 01:28:12,204
That's why Trick No. 2.

1431
01:28:14,704 --> 01:28:16,413
Going wild at the enemy's wedding.

1432
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:17,621
Who's the bridegroom?

1433
01:28:17,746 --> 01:28:19,579
H3's TT champ. Venkatesh.

1434
01:28:19,704 --> 01:28:22,663
And who is going wild?

1435
01:28:24,913 --> 01:28:25,871
Maya.

1436
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:29,329
What are you doing in a library?

1437
01:28:30,246 --> 01:28:31,371
I miss you.

1438
01:28:31,663 --> 01:28:32,121
What?

1439
01:28:32,204 --> 01:28:33,913
Anni's message, for you.

1440
01:28:34,746 --> 01:28:35,954
I miss you too.

1441
01:28:36,413 --> 01:28:37,579
I know.

1442
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:40,079
That's my message for Anni.

1443
01:28:40,663 --> 01:28:43,413
If you are missing him so
much then please do him a favour.

1444
01:28:43,996 --> 01:28:45,746
Make a phone call at 03:00 am.

1445
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:47,121
But Anni won't talk to me.

1446
01:28:47,204 --> 01:28:48,454
Not Anni.

1447
01:28:48,788 --> 01:28:50,413
Venkatesh from H3.

1448
01:28:50,496 --> 01:28:52,371
Room No. 175.

1449
01:28:52,538 --> 01:28:55,454
You see,
he has ping-pong match tomorrow.

1450
01:28:55,704 --> 01:28:56,829
Poor child.

1451
01:28:57,163 --> 01:29:01,246
How will he win gold if he
doesn't sleep during golden hour?

1452
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:03,704
You guys are so cruel.

1453
01:29:03,788 --> 01:29:05,121
My mom agrees.

1454
01:29:07,204 --> 01:29:08,121
What is it?

1455
01:29:10,371 --> 01:29:11,079
Hello?

1456
01:29:11,163 --> 01:29:12,246
Hello!

1457
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:15,163
- Who is it?
- Your fan.

1458
01:29:16,704 --> 01:29:17,371
Who?

1459
01:29:17,454 --> 01:29:18,871
You play ping-pong so well.

1460
01:29:19,163 --> 01:29:22,538
Oh my!
Will you teach me, handsome?

1461
01:29:22,621 --> 01:29:23,538
Yes.

1462
01:29:23,746 --> 01:29:27,704
Venky, let's spend
the whole night talking.

1463
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:29,246
The whole night.

1464
01:29:30,246 --> 01:29:33,954
Now imagine, just you and me...

1465
01:29:34,288 --> 01:29:35,788
On the ping-pong table.

1466
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,704
All night long.

1467
01:29:54,704 --> 01:29:55,621
Look at them.

1468
01:29:55,746 --> 01:29:56,913
Come on, Venky! Come on.

1469
01:30:01,454 --> 01:30:02,663
What is he doing?

1470
01:30:08,829 --> 01:30:09,371
Focus!

1471
01:30:09,454 --> 01:30:10,871
What are you doing, man!

1472
01:30:24,413 --> 01:30:26,204
H3 has been ripped apart!

1473
01:30:26,288 --> 01:30:28,079
Zig zag! Zig zag!

1474
01:30:28,163 --> 01:30:29,871
H3 has been ripped apart!

1475
01:30:29,954 --> 01:30:31,704
Zig zag! Zig zag!

1476
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,204
Come on, guys.

1477
01:30:40,454 --> 01:30:42,079
This isn't a match we should have lost.

1478
01:30:42,746 --> 01:30:44,454
Since when did we
start losing against H8?

1479
01:30:44,913 --> 01:30:45,829
Huh?

1480
01:30:51,621 --> 01:30:53,329
I know you want to say thank you.

1481
01:30:57,996 --> 01:30:58,788
It's okay.

1482
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,663
How about getting me a pastry instead?

1483
01:31:17,746 --> 01:31:18,704
Sit.

1484
01:31:24,204 --> 01:31:29,913
Back then, Anni and I
could understand each other...

1485
01:31:30,704 --> 01:31:32,996
...even when we couldn't
talk to each other.

1486
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:39,038
Now no matter how much we talk.

1487
01:31:40,496 --> 01:31:42,163
Neither does she
want to understand me...

1488
01:31:43,663 --> 01:31:45,163
...nor do I.

1489
01:31:45,329 --> 01:31:46,788
Whose fault was it?

1490
01:31:48,163 --> 01:31:49,288
Maybe it was mine.

1491
01:31:50,496 --> 01:31:51,829
Maybe it was mine.

1492
01:31:52,788 --> 01:31:54,954
Whenever I should
have apologised...

1493
01:31:57,371 --> 01:31:58,454
...I didn't.

1494
01:32:00,038 --> 01:32:04,371
Whenever I should have
said it's okay and hugged him...

1495
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:07,663
...I didn't.

1496
01:32:11,288 --> 01:32:13,454
Raghav was the only
common link between us.

1497
01:32:14,496 --> 01:32:17,163
And look at that poor
boy's condition now.

1498
01:32:17,954 --> 01:32:19,829
It's just like our relationship.

1499
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:25,538
There is no condition we
cannot revive ourselves from.

1500
01:32:27,954 --> 01:32:29,954
We've learnt this from you.

1501
01:32:31,538 --> 01:32:32,538
So, my friends...

1502
01:32:33,204 --> 01:32:34,496
Trick No. 3.

1503
01:32:36,413 --> 01:32:39,746
If you don't have any talent, use tact.

1504
01:32:46,204 --> 01:32:47,413
He has the pace...

1505
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:49,329
...but he doesn't have the line.

1506
01:32:49,413 --> 01:32:50,663
Just a second.

1507
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:54,371
Chris-cross!

1508
01:32:54,913 --> 01:32:57,246
Throw the ball assuming
that the stump is over here.

1509
01:32:57,329 --> 01:32:58,079
Over there?

1510
01:32:58,163 --> 01:32:58,996
But that will be a wide.

1511
01:32:59,121 --> 01:33:00,621
Oh, come on. Throw it over here.

1512
01:33:09,538 --> 01:33:10,538
You can do it.

1513
01:33:11,079 --> 01:33:12,204
Chris-cross!

1514
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:31,204
How is he?

1515
01:33:31,288 --> 01:33:33,329
Looks somewhere else
and throws somewhere else.

1516
01:33:33,996 --> 01:33:35,163
Be careful, bro.

1517
01:33:35,454 --> 01:33:36,329
Okay.

1518
01:33:39,121 --> 01:33:40,121
'Pandu'.

1519
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:41,829
Today, you won't be cooking for others.

1520
01:33:42,038 --> 01:33:42,996
We'll be fooling others today.

1521
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:45,829
We have a Kabaddi match. Let's go.

1522
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,121
Like this.

1523
01:33:48,746 --> 01:33:49,621
Like this.

1524
01:33:52,163 --> 01:33:53,329
Shit.

1525
01:33:55,121 --> 01:33:56,788
I'll be damned.

1526
01:33:56,871 --> 01:33:58,496
They have brought themselves a coach?

1527
01:33:58,663 --> 01:33:59,788
What do I need to do, sir?

1528
01:33:59,913 --> 01:34:00,996
Teach us how to cook potato curry.

1529
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:02,621
Take four potatoes and two...

1530
01:34:03,288 --> 01:34:04,496
With an angry face.

1531
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:05,996
Four potatoes,
two onions and one tomato.

1532
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:07,621
Finely chop them.
Finely chop them.

1533
01:34:07,704 --> 01:34:09,954
They seem to be cooking
a deadly strategy.

1534
01:34:11,704 --> 01:34:13,663
Guys, make sure you don't
end up with broken bones.

1535
01:34:13,746 --> 01:34:14,538
Yes.

1536
01:34:16,663 --> 01:34:19,913
'H8 had accepted defeat
even before the match began.'

1537
01:34:19,996 --> 01:34:21,996
Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

1538
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:24,871
Smash him! Go for him! Get him!

1539
01:34:24,954 --> 01:34:26,621
Anni, go for his leg.

1540
01:34:26,704 --> 01:34:28,079
Turn it into mincemeat!

1541
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,079
Get him!

1542
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:33,704
'Your Highness,
you don't know the power of love.'

1543
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:35,621
We have a football match with H3.

1544
01:34:36,788 --> 01:34:38,413
What will we do?

1545
01:34:38,996 --> 01:34:40,788
Who will stop their Maradona and Pele?

1546
01:34:40,954 --> 01:34:42,663
Don't go, Chandralekha!

1547
01:34:42,788 --> 01:34:43,663
No!

1548
01:34:44,371 --> 01:34:46,996
This cruel world cannot separate us.

1549
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:48,996
Soldiers, separate them.

1550
01:34:49,121 --> 01:34:50,246
Come back, Chandralekha.

1551
01:34:50,329 --> 01:34:51,621
You want to stop Maradona and Pele?

1552
01:34:51,704 --> 01:34:53,704
- Come back, Chandralekha.
- He will stop them.

1553
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,163
Don't go, Chandralekha!

1554
01:34:55,413 --> 01:34:56,788
Chandru!

1555
01:34:57,496 --> 01:34:58,413
He will?

1556
01:34:58,663 --> 01:34:59,579
Wait and watch.

1557
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:03,079
Raggie! Over here.
Come on! Raggie, pass.

1558
01:35:03,163 --> 01:35:04,371
Raggie, over here.

1559
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:06,079
Raggie, come on!

1560
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:08,288
- That's a foul!
- Foul!

1561
01:35:08,371 --> 01:35:10,163
That's cheating, Ref!

1562
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:12,538
He's just pretending to be hurt.

1563
01:35:12,704 --> 01:35:16,204
It's nothing, Ref!
He's just pretending to be hurt.

1564
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:18,163
- It's clear, he's just acting hurt.
- You are the one who is acting.

1565
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:21,496
- What are you doing over there?
- What are you doing, man?

1566
01:35:21,579 --> 01:35:23,913
- You are unnecessarily blaming me.
- Okay fine, it's okay.

1567
01:35:25,121 --> 01:35:27,079
- Cheating!
- Foul! Foul!

1568
01:35:27,454 --> 01:35:30,579
He's cheating! It's clear he's cheating!

1569
01:35:36,496 --> 01:35:37,496
Pele?

1570
01:35:38,038 --> 01:35:39,121
Gone.

1571
01:35:41,954 --> 01:35:45,246
Derek, toast him! Smash him!

1572
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:48,413
Crush him!

1573
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:51,329
Turn him into Mincemeat!

1574
01:35:52,871 --> 01:35:54,121
Roast him!

1575
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:55,621
Yes!

1576
01:35:55,704 --> 01:35:57,454
Oh, they are so scared!

1577
01:35:57,538 --> 01:35:58,996
Come on ref, it's not a penalty.

1578
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:01,288
It's clear that it's cheating.
This bloody loser is cheating.

1579
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:02,829
Come on, ref!

1580
01:36:16,163 --> 01:36:19,746
Don't toss me like noodles on a pan.

1581
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:35,829
H3's hen!

1582
01:36:35,954 --> 01:36:37,663
H4's rooster!

1583
01:36:37,746 --> 01:36:40,663
Slam-bang! Slam-bang!

1584
01:36:40,746 --> 01:36:42,663
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1585
01:36:42,746 --> 01:36:43,579
Go for it.

1586
01:36:43,788 --> 01:36:45,204
We should have brought Pandu along.

1587
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:48,538
We lost our reputation.

1588
01:36:48,746 --> 01:36:50,746
Uncle, get our drinks.

1589
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:54,621
Look, someone is here
to drown in their defeat.

1590
01:36:54,704 --> 01:36:56,704
We aren't used to losing like you.

1591
01:36:56,788 --> 01:36:58,538
Didn't the dog say that he would bite?

1592
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:00,121
He's still barking.

1593
01:37:00,204 --> 01:37:03,371
Acid, mind your language
or I'll give it to you.

1594
01:37:03,454 --> 01:37:05,996
You just lost,
what do you have left to give?

1595
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:07,663
- Raggie, drop it. Raggie.
- Buzz off.

1596
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:08,621
Sit.

1597
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:11,579
H3 are fatheads!

1598
01:37:11,954 --> 01:37:13,454
H3 are fatheads!

1599
01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:16,829
They are a sunken boat.
There no longer have support.

1600
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:18,413
H3 are fatheads!

1601
01:37:18,496 --> 01:37:20,079
H3 are fatheads!

1602
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:21,746
We have burst their bubble.

1603
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:23,371
Now they are in trouble.

1604
01:37:23,454 --> 01:37:25,079
H3 are fatheads!

1605
01:37:25,163 --> 01:37:26,704
H3 are fatheads!

1606
01:37:26,788 --> 01:37:30,204
They are stumped,
They're going to get hum...

1607
01:37:30,288 --> 01:37:31,704
H3 are fatheads!

1608
01:37:31,788 --> 01:37:33,329
H3 are fatheads!

1609
01:37:33,413 --> 01:37:34,996
H3 are fatheads!

1610
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:36,579
H3 are fatheads!

1611
01:37:36,663 --> 01:37:37,538
Hey!

1612
01:37:38,288 --> 01:37:39,371
You...

1613
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:40,329
Guys!

1614
01:37:54,163 --> 01:37:56,829
Mummy, why are you just standing there?
Do something!

1615
01:38:17,913 --> 01:38:19,288
How cute, Kammo!

1616
01:38:19,371 --> 01:38:21,413
There were six boys
from H3 over there...

1617
01:38:21,538 --> 01:38:23,371
...and you ended up punching yourself?

1618
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:24,746
How, dude?

1619
01:38:26,496 --> 01:38:29,371
Buffoons, you think this is funny?

1620
01:38:29,454 --> 01:38:30,204
No, bro.

1621
01:38:30,288 --> 01:38:32,663
He has a carrom quarterfinals
match in the evening.

1622
01:38:33,206 --> 01:38:33,914
How will he play?

1623
01:38:34,329 --> 01:38:35,204
Did anyone think about that?

1624
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:39,121
Derek...

1625
01:38:42,996 --> 01:38:48,163
Pain can hurt us only
when we let the pain hurt us.

1626
01:38:49,913 --> 01:38:53,246
And I won't let pain
hurt me in this match.

1627
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:55,121
It will come.

1628
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:56,788
Knock at the door.

1629
01:38:58,621 --> 01:38:59,454
And go back.

1630
01:39:01,163 --> 01:39:02,746
This is a man's promise.

1631
01:39:03,829 --> 01:39:04,538
A man's promise.

1632
01:39:04,704 --> 01:39:07,413
I think he has hurt his head as well.

1633
01:39:50,829 --> 01:39:53,329
- Mummy!
- Mummy!

1634
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:55,746
- Mummy!
- Mummy!

1635
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:57,371
Mummy!

1636
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,371
'That day Mummy got
full points for bravery.'

1637
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:07,663
'But H4 got zero points for carrom.'

1638
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:10,121
Sorry, guys.

1639
01:40:12,788 --> 01:40:14,371
We had assumed gold for Mummy.

1640
01:40:15,329 --> 01:40:18,913
We need to get a gold
anyhow to stay in GC.

1641
01:40:18,996 --> 01:40:22,163
Otherwise, we lose GC.

1642
01:40:23,746 --> 01:40:24,579
Are you crazy?

1643
01:40:25,538 --> 01:40:27,163
There are so many sport events left.

1644
01:40:27,829 --> 01:40:29,329
Try to squeeze out an extra gold.

1645
01:40:29,413 --> 01:40:31,413
From where do I get it?
We have calculated everything to the T!

1646
01:40:31,496 --> 01:40:33,579
Javelin? No chance.

1647
01:40:33,704 --> 01:40:34,996
Hammer throw? No chance.

1648
01:40:35,288 --> 01:40:36,871
That leaves us with
42 kilo weight-lifting.

1649
01:40:37,288 --> 01:40:38,204
It's just there as a formality.

1650
01:40:38,913 --> 01:40:40,454
No one has participated since 10 years.

1651
01:40:42,454 --> 01:40:43,371
Why?

1652
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:45,996
From where will we get
a boy who weighs 42 kilos?

1653
01:40:51,454 --> 01:40:53,996
Why such stinginess, man?
Fill it to the brim.

1654
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:56,329
Your body won't be able
to digest so much milk.

1655
01:40:56,413 --> 01:40:58,454
It's my body.
You cannot know it better than me.

1656
01:40:58,538 --> 01:41:01,746
- Fill it to the brim.
- Danda, how much do you weigh?

1657
01:41:02,288 --> 01:41:03,496
Minus the watch.

1658
01:41:05,413 --> 01:41:06,788
44 kilos.

1659
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:10,163
I know, it's too less.

1660
01:41:10,246 --> 01:41:12,913
No, rather two kilos in excess.

1661
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:14,829
Huh?

1662
01:41:16,954 --> 01:41:17,329
Let's go.

1663
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:20,871
If not for the pledge, I'd lose
the two kilos with just a few twists.

1664
01:41:21,329 --> 01:41:23,413
Doesn't it feel like
he is being dragged by the wind?

1665
01:41:23,538 --> 01:41:25,579
Where will he lose those two kilos from?

1666
01:41:28,454 --> 01:41:30,413
23, 24, 25...

1667
01:41:30,621 --> 01:41:32,288
We are sure to get
gold in weightlifting.

1668
01:41:32,496 --> 01:41:35,413
But I don't know how to lift weights.

1669
01:41:35,496 --> 01:41:37,788
Even if you manage to lift 100 grams,
you will win gold.

1670
01:41:37,913 --> 01:41:39,413
No one else is going to
participate in your category anyway.

1671
01:41:40,329 --> 01:41:41,621
Who asked you to stop?

1672
01:41:41,704 --> 01:41:42,996
- Go, go, go.
- Faster.

1673
01:41:44,788 --> 01:41:46,579
42, 43, 44...

1674
01:41:47,954 --> 01:41:49,704
He's one kilo overweight, bro.

1675
01:41:54,913 --> 01:41:57,454
Try to get up, come on.

1676
01:41:57,996 --> 01:42:00,204
- Come on.
- I cannot do this anymore.

1677
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:10,163
Danda, bro! Try to understand, man.

1678
01:42:10,246 --> 01:42:12,496
You were only 100 grams
overweight last night.

1679
01:42:12,579 --> 01:42:13,788
Get 150 grams out of the system.

1680
01:42:13,913 --> 01:42:15,663
End of story.
We cannot take a chance.

1681
01:42:15,746 --> 01:42:18,371
How can I get anything out when
you guys didn't let anything go inside?

1682
01:42:18,454 --> 01:42:19,579
Come on, dude.

1683
01:42:19,663 --> 01:42:21,413
I didn't see anything!
I didn't see anything!

1684
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:24,663
Okay.

1685
01:42:28,538 --> 01:42:32,913
And in the 42 kilo category
we have Abhimanyu Rathore from H4...

1686
01:42:35,121 --> 01:42:38,163
...and Dulari Pitroda from H10.

1687
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:45,329
Who threw this googly?

1688
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,704
Why cheat us like this?

1689
01:42:51,121 --> 01:42:54,246
I didn't know you guys
would get a 42 kilo gem.

1690
01:42:55,204 --> 01:42:56,996
See, if you can get her to withdraw.

1691
01:42:57,954 --> 01:42:59,121
Too late, man.

1692
01:43:01,954 --> 01:43:03,163
She says it is too late.

1693
01:43:04,496 --> 01:43:05,996
What now, bro?

1694
01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:10,829
Danda, you are now
at that point in life...

1695
01:43:11,121 --> 01:43:12,579
...where you need to think about...

1696
01:43:12,746 --> 01:43:14,663
...your reputation and
not the hostel's reputation.

1697
01:43:14,746 --> 01:43:15,329
Yes, kiddo.

1698
01:43:15,413 --> 01:43:17,621
Because if you lose to that
girl there then these monsters...

1699
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:21,413
...will make your life a living hell.

1700
01:43:21,746 --> 01:43:22,996
I will use batons on you,
I am warning you.

1701
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:24,788
You don't want that, do you, kiddo?

1702
01:43:25,704 --> 01:43:27,121
Then go and save yourself.

1703
01:43:27,621 --> 01:43:28,579
Hail Goddess!

1704
01:43:28,788 --> 01:43:30,454
That's it, kiddo.
Save your energy.

1705
01:43:36,996 --> 01:43:38,163
Hold on tight!

1706
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:40,371
Sexa, not to a girl.

1707
01:43:41,246 --> 01:43:42,829
- Sorry.
- Come on Pitroda!

1708
01:43:42,996 --> 01:43:43,746
Yes!

1709
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:50,621
Save yourself, bro.

1710
01:43:50,704 --> 01:43:51,746
Lift it up, bro.

1711
01:43:57,996 --> 01:43:59,246
Yes!

1712
01:44:00,704 --> 01:44:03,538
Go! Come on, Pitroda. Lift it.

1713
01:44:25,871 --> 01:44:28,163
Very good! Come on! Lift it!

1714
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:29,454
We have to win!

1715
01:44:29,538 --> 01:44:31,288
Come on! Pitroda! Come on!

1716
01:44:32,329 --> 01:44:33,204
Yes!

1717
01:44:34,454 --> 01:44:36,121
Well tried. Well tried.

1718
01:44:36,746 --> 01:44:37,996
Come on, Danda!

1719
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:39,996
It's easy, Danda.

1720
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:06,871
Yes!

1721
01:45:22,663 --> 01:45:25,788
'Danda's gold brought
joy back to the hostel.'

1722
01:45:26,204 --> 01:45:30,288
'And the soul of the hostel
too came back from the hospital.'

1723
01:45:55,204 --> 01:45:59,954
All the hostels started getting
nervous as GC progressed.

1724
01:46:03,329 --> 01:46:05,829
'Like every year, H3 in the lead.'

1725
01:46:06,288 --> 01:46:07,538
'But for the first time...

1726
01:46:07,788 --> 01:46:09,204
...H4 wasn't right in the end.'

1727
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:19,996
'H4 was not longer scared of H3.'

1728
01:46:20,496 --> 01:46:23,871
'We used our tricks
to win many sport events.'

1729
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:25,621
Anni, smooth as butter.

1730
01:46:26,454 --> 01:46:27,829
Amazing!

1731
01:46:27,996 --> 01:46:29,204
Butter!

1732
01:46:29,288 --> 01:46:31,996
Hello, were you sleeping?

1733
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:36,996
- Hold him tight!
- Oh yeah!

1734
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:39,454
- Use your might!
- Oh yeah!

1735
01:46:40,579 --> 01:46:45,121
'But there were some sports
which we won with to sheer talent.'

1736
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:01,454
'What was the most important
thing here is that...'

1737
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:03,996
'...for the first time there
were chances that we could win GC.'

1738
01:47:04,121 --> 01:47:05,121
What do you say?

1739
01:47:06,246 --> 01:47:07,288
Do we stand a chance?

1740
01:47:07,913 --> 01:47:08,996
We do.

1741
01:47:09,329 --> 01:47:10,413
Thanks, man.

1742
01:47:11,288 --> 01:47:13,954
- If not for you...
- No man, thanks to you.

1743
01:47:14,746 --> 01:47:15,996
You had started the story...

1744
01:47:17,079 --> 01:47:18,913
And we will all end it together.

1745
01:47:20,246 --> 01:47:23,954
'There was just one
day left for GC to end.'

1746
01:47:25,996 --> 01:47:29,038
Our rooster is getting
too close to their hen.

1747
01:47:29,871 --> 01:47:30,913
Cheers.

1748
01:47:31,204 --> 01:47:33,204
Bevda (Boozer), I hope that's water.

1749
01:47:33,288 --> 01:47:34,413
Yes, bro.

1750
01:47:36,163 --> 01:47:38,454
Tomorrow,
I'll get to hear my mother's voice.

1751
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:40,996
Tomorrow,
I'll get to utter a cuss of my choice.

1752
01:47:42,704 --> 01:47:44,454
Tomorrow, first it will be Playboy.

1753
01:47:44,913 --> 01:47:46,996
Then I play with the boy.

1754
01:47:47,079 --> 01:47:48,954
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

1755
01:47:49,204 --> 01:47:50,163
One second.

1756
01:47:50,663 --> 01:47:51,996
GC is not over yet.

1757
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:53,496
We have last three finals tomorrow.

1758
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:56,496
We are competing with
H3 in all three of them.

1759
01:47:57,079 --> 01:48:00,663
And H3 is still 5 points ahead of us.

1760
01:48:00,746 --> 01:48:02,788
If we win three golds...

1761
01:48:04,246 --> 01:48:06,163
...our final score will be...

1762
01:48:07,496 --> 01:48:08,329
"SEVENTY FIVE"

1763
01:48:08,996 --> 01:48:10,913
And H3's score will be...

1764
01:48:12,454 --> 01:48:13,329
"SEVENTY FOUR"

1765
01:48:13,734 --> 01:48:14,871
Do you know what this means?

1766
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:16,996
But if we lose even a single match...

1767
01:48:17,746 --> 01:48:19,079
...then we will lose GC.

1768
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:22,371
Bevda will handle Chess.

1769
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,704
For relay, we have Derek and Acid.

1770
01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:27,538
But this... basketball.

1771
01:48:28,121 --> 01:48:29,371
Has anyone thought about this?

1772
01:48:29,454 --> 01:48:30,996
Why do we need to worry
when you are in the team, darling?

1773
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,746
No, its not so easy
to defeat H3 in basketball.

1774
01:48:37,329 --> 01:48:40,354
Anyway, we must take rest now.

1775
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:43,174
Tomorrow is a very important day for us.

1776
01:48:45,171 --> 01:48:48,296
Mr. Pathak, doctor would
like to have a word with you.

1777
01:48:49,504 --> 01:48:51,671
The swelling in Raghav's
brain has increased further.

1778
01:48:53,087 --> 01:48:54,379
He is stable for now.

1779
01:48:55,587 --> 01:48:58,004
So, we will wait
till tomorrow morning.

1780
01:48:58,462 --> 01:49:02,754
If there is no improvement, we will
have to go ahead with a surgery.

1781
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:06,629
But we have no other option, really.

1782
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:14,046
Please sign this consent form.

1783
01:49:16,337 --> 01:49:17,254
Consent form, sir?

1784
01:49:17,462 --> 01:49:20,004
If anything happens to the
patient during the surgery then...

1785
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:21,754
Yes, I understand.

1786
01:49:42,296 --> 01:49:44,837
Son, we will need to leave now.

1787
01:49:46,129 --> 01:49:46,879
We will continue tomorrow.

1788
01:49:47,004 --> 01:49:50,254
But papa,
we are almost at the end now.

1789
01:49:50,337 --> 01:49:52,921
No son, doctor has strictly
said that you need to rest.

1790
01:49:59,004 --> 01:50:03,504
Look kiddo, neither are we going
anywhere, nor are you.

1791
01:50:04,004 --> 01:50:08,587
Yes. Anyway, we had spent
that night in suspense...

1792
01:50:09,337 --> 01:50:11,504
...so you spend this
night in suspense as well.

1793
01:50:19,087 --> 01:50:20,587
Don't worry, guys.

1794
01:50:21,462 --> 01:50:23,004
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

1795
01:50:23,587 --> 01:50:25,171
I don't know, man.

1796
01:50:27,546 --> 01:50:30,129
This situation should've never
reached here in the first place...

1797
01:50:31,379 --> 01:50:33,004
...and it is all because of me.

1798
01:50:33,087 --> 01:50:35,462
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

1799
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:36,587
He's right.

1800
01:50:37,129 --> 01:50:38,337
You are a very cool dad.

1801
01:50:39,462 --> 01:50:41,004
I am cool, right?

1802
01:50:42,421 --> 01:50:43,754
You see that bottle?

1803
01:50:45,462 --> 01:50:51,171
I had told Raghav that we would
drink together the day he gets selected.

1804
01:50:51,879 --> 01:50:55,171
But I didn't tell him what we would
have done if he doesn't get selected.

1805
01:50:59,129 --> 01:51:01,171
We're all doing it wrong.

1806
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:05,796
We have plans ready for
what happens after one succeeds.

1807
01:51:06,712 --> 01:51:11,379
But if by chance one fails, we're not
equipping them to deal with failure...

1808
01:51:11,671 --> 01:51:13,421
...and no one wants
to talk about that.

1809
01:51:14,796 --> 01:51:17,462
Son, score this much and you
will get admission in this college.

1810
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:20,712
Son, get admitted in this
college and you will get that job.

1811
01:51:22,296 --> 01:51:24,379
One million kids apply
for the entrance exam.

1812
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:27,837
Only 10,000 kids get selected.

1813
01:51:28,504 --> 01:51:30,837
990,000 kids...

1814
01:51:32,546 --> 01:51:34,337
...don't even know what to do.

1815
01:51:34,879 --> 01:51:36,421
They never prepared
themselves for it.

1816
01:51:39,337 --> 01:51:41,962
They don't think they've
failed in just an exam...

1817
01:51:42,212 --> 01:51:44,296
...they think they've
failed in life.

1818
01:51:45,754 --> 01:51:49,004
If you ask me what I want today...

1819
01:51:49,879 --> 01:51:51,837
A seat for Raghav in
an engineering college or...

1820
01:51:54,587 --> 01:51:58,296
Or my son to come back
to me safe and sound...

1821
01:51:59,837 --> 01:52:02,379
Obviously, I would want my son back.

1822
01:52:04,379 --> 01:52:06,421
I don't want anything else.

1823
01:52:16,129 --> 01:52:16,962
I'm sorry.

1824
01:52:18,129 --> 01:52:18,962
Excuse me.

1825
01:52:27,087 --> 01:52:28,629
Hey, is Vedant there?

1826
01:52:29,129 --> 01:52:30,296
I wanna talk to him.

1827
01:52:31,254 --> 01:52:32,462
Hey, buddy!

1828
01:52:35,587 --> 01:52:37,462
Do you remember my promise?

1829
01:52:38,129 --> 01:52:39,004
Yes, that one.

1830
01:52:39,087 --> 01:52:43,421
That I would get you a bike
if you get A+ in mathematics.

1831
01:52:44,379 --> 01:52:45,254
But you know what?

1832
01:52:45,587 --> 01:52:48,004
I just wanna tell you that
no matter what your grades are...

1833
01:52:49,254 --> 01:52:52,421
B+, C-, it doesn't matter.

1834
01:52:54,504 --> 01:52:56,421
I shall still get you the bike.

1835
01:52:57,587 --> 01:52:59,587
No, daddy is not kidding.

1836
01:53:01,587 --> 01:53:02,879
Son, I love you!

1837
01:53:12,837 --> 01:53:13,921
I was wrong.

1838
01:53:16,171 --> 01:53:18,671
You are a very good father.

1839
01:53:19,879 --> 01:53:21,212
I am sorry.

1840
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,087
I am also sorry.

1841
01:53:25,129 --> 01:53:26,712
Had I tried harder...

1842
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:30,629
...I would have been
a good husband too.

1843
01:54:43,921 --> 01:54:45,171
I think you should sleep.

1844
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,671
You should go and rest too.

1845
01:55:00,254 --> 01:55:01,171
Yes, doctor?

1846
01:55:07,379 --> 01:55:09,962
Raghav had severe convulsions...

1847
01:55:11,087 --> 01:55:14,504
...which has increased the
bleeding in his brain.

1848
01:55:16,462 --> 01:55:19,671
As an emergency procedure,
we have to take him for surgery now.

1849
01:55:22,712 --> 01:55:24,546
Sir, how much time do
we have before the surgery?

1850
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:26,837
Around 15 minutes,
to prepare the operation theatre.

1851
01:55:26,921 --> 01:55:27,921
Why?

1852
01:55:28,462 --> 01:55:31,546
Sir, I know this might
sound strange to you.

1853
01:55:32,504 --> 01:55:35,546
But can we spend the next
10 minutes with Raghav, sir?

1854
01:55:36,087 --> 01:55:36,837
Please, sir.

1855
01:55:36,921 --> 01:55:39,504
It is extremely important
for him to know the end, sir.

1856
01:55:39,587 --> 01:55:40,754
Please, sir.

1857
01:55:41,004 --> 01:55:42,337
Mr. Pathak?

1858
01:55:42,421 --> 01:55:44,129
Only 10 minutes, sir.

1859
01:55:44,337 --> 01:55:45,546
10 minutes, sir. Please.

1860
01:55:46,004 --> 01:55:47,296
I don't believe you.

1861
01:55:49,212 --> 01:55:50,587
I believe him, sir.

1862
01:55:54,921 --> 01:55:56,421
It's important. Please.

1863
01:56:02,609 --> 01:56:03,651
So...

1864
01:56:04,526 --> 01:56:06,401
...ready for the climax, Kammo?

1865
01:56:22,026 --> 01:56:24,526
These losers played
quite a long game.

1866
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:28,859
They need three golds, right?

1867
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:33,359
I won't let them win even one.

1868
01:56:49,526 --> 01:56:50,859
Won't you invite me in?

1869
01:56:58,026 --> 01:57:01,443
You forgot our friendship
because of GC, man!

1870
01:57:02,859 --> 01:57:03,984
But I didn't.

1871
01:57:04,609 --> 01:57:05,943
Relax.

1872
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:08,359
I have come to say
best of luck to you.

1873
01:57:08,901 --> 01:57:10,609
You guys are playing really well.

1874
01:57:12,026 --> 01:57:15,026
You can have it either
to celebrate tomorrow's victory...

1875
01:57:15,818 --> 01:57:17,734
...or to drown in
your sorrows if you lose.

1876
01:57:20,026 --> 01:57:22,068
But don't drink it before the game.

1877
01:57:23,859 --> 01:57:25,234
Let's have a fair fight.

1878
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:52,318
Did you check on him in the morning?

1879
01:57:52,401 --> 01:57:54,609
I didn't personally check,
but I am sure he must be up by now.

1880
01:57:55,818 --> 01:57:56,901
Where is your player?

1881
01:57:56,984 --> 01:57:58,734
He will be here
in five minutes, sir.

1882
01:58:00,318 --> 01:58:01,193
Where is he?

1883
01:58:01,276 --> 01:58:02,443
I have no clue.

1884
01:58:04,318 --> 01:58:05,318
Sir, he is...

1885
01:58:08,443 --> 01:58:09,901
Where the hell have you been?

1886
01:58:12,609 --> 01:58:13,651
Are you drunk?

1887
01:58:14,443 --> 01:58:15,526
Move.

1888
01:58:17,943 --> 01:58:20,401
Anni, you should leave.
You have a game to play.

1889
01:58:23,526 --> 01:58:24,359
Scoundrel.

1890
01:58:24,526 --> 01:58:25,901
You don't need to worry, man.

1891
01:58:26,151 --> 01:58:26,859
This race is ours.

1892
01:58:26,943 --> 01:58:28,776
Maintain the 150 meter
sprint at a medium pace.

1893
01:58:28,984 --> 01:58:29,859
Oh shit.

1894
01:58:31,526 --> 01:58:33,193
Watch it, man!

1895
01:58:34,234 --> 01:58:35,443
Watch it, man! Apologise!

1896
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:36,609
Sorry.

1897
01:58:42,151 --> 01:58:43,359
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1898
01:58:43,443 --> 01:58:44,734
It was an accident.
He apologised.

1899
01:58:45,984 --> 01:58:47,347
Can't you guys see?

1900
01:58:49,693 --> 01:58:50,840
Hey, are you okay man?

1901
01:58:51,901 --> 01:58:53,318
What is the point
of winning like this?

1902
01:58:54,859 --> 01:58:56,151
Take care, Derek.

1903
01:58:59,651 --> 01:59:01,568
H3, H3!

1904
01:59:01,776 --> 01:59:03,859
H3, H3!

1905
01:59:04,026 --> 01:59:06,151
H3, H3!

1906
01:59:06,318 --> 01:59:08,568
H3, H3!

1907
01:59:08,734 --> 01:59:10,859
H3, H3!

1908
01:59:11,068 --> 01:59:13,359
What did you think?
Only H4 knows how to cheer?

1909
01:59:24,109 --> 01:59:25,651
Shot. Well played, well played.

1910
01:59:25,734 --> 01:59:27,443
- This game is ours.
- Come on, boys.

1911
01:59:52,984 --> 01:59:53,901
Are you okay?

1912
02:00:32,068 --> 02:00:33,234
Will you be able to run?

1913
02:00:35,734 --> 02:00:37,109
I will have to.

1914
02:00:37,609 --> 02:00:38,845
On your marks.

1915
02:00:42,901 --> 02:00:44,109
Set!

1916
02:00:48,734 --> 02:00:50,109
Come on, Siddhesh!

1917
02:00:50,443 --> 02:00:51,401
Come on!

1918
02:00:55,443 --> 02:00:56,776
Well played.

1919
02:00:56,943 --> 02:00:58,276
This is how you should play.

1920
02:01:22,318 --> 02:01:23,026
Come on, Siddhesh!

1921
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,734
Come on, H3! Come on, come on!

1922
02:01:24,818 --> 02:01:25,943
Siddhesh, pick up some pace!

1923
02:01:26,026 --> 02:01:27,901
Run faster, Siddhesh!

1924
02:01:35,318 --> 02:01:36,984
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.

1925
02:01:46,318 --> 02:01:48,901
Run faster! Suraj, take off!

1926
02:01:50,526 --> 02:01:52,318
Come on Suraj!

1927
02:02:12,109 --> 02:02:13,526
Suraj, pick up pace!

1928
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:15,609
Decrease the gap as much as you can.

1929
02:02:20,026 --> 02:02:21,484
Come on, H4!

1930
02:02:39,026 --> 02:02:39,984
Check.

1931
02:03:01,818 --> 02:03:03,734
And there, GC slips away.

1932
02:03:06,776 --> 02:03:08,068
Come on, H3!

1933
02:03:43,568 --> 02:03:44,776
Check.

1934
02:04:09,234 --> 02:04:10,609
It's okay.

1935
02:04:17,193 --> 02:04:18,359
Come on, man!

1936
02:04:34,068 --> 02:04:36,734
Good going, Derek! Very good!

1937
02:04:44,651 --> 02:04:46,609
Come on, guys! Come on!
This is not how we play.

1938
02:04:46,984 --> 02:04:48,609
Come on! Come on!

1939
02:05:16,068 --> 02:05:17,443
Come on, Derek!

1940
02:05:20,234 --> 02:05:22,026
Come on, come on, defence.

1941
02:05:28,068 --> 02:05:28,984
Yes!

1942
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:35,318
Come on guys, fight!

1943
02:05:40,484 --> 02:05:41,443
Shit!

1944
02:06:02,526 --> 02:06:03,818
You made two mistakes.

1945
02:06:12,776 --> 02:06:14,401
Very good!

1946
02:06:24,984 --> 02:06:27,734
One: You assumed that I am drunk.

1947
02:06:30,901 --> 02:06:32,026
Derek!

1948
02:06:34,984 --> 02:06:36,859
Very good, Derek! Yes!

1949
02:06:44,401 --> 02:06:45,651
Yes!

1950
02:06:49,859 --> 02:06:50,901
Two.

1951
02:06:51,318 --> 02:06:53,484
You didn't study Kasparov's games.

1952
02:06:54,401 --> 02:06:57,734
Otherwise, I wouldn't have ever
sacrificed my queen even if I was drunk.

1953
02:07:02,068 --> 02:07:03,276
Check.

1954
02:07:40,734 --> 02:07:42,526
Yes!

1955
02:08:01,068 --> 02:08:02,609
Bevda, you rascal!

1956
02:08:12,693 --> 02:08:13,943
Hey!

1957
02:08:23,818 --> 02:08:25,079
We have only six seconds.

1958
02:08:25,151 --> 02:08:26,818
And they are still
leading with two points.

1959
02:08:28,193 --> 02:08:30,884
You give me the pass.
I will try a three-pointer.

1960
02:08:31,526 --> 02:08:32,401
Guys?

1961
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:12,276
Even after trying so hard,
you guys lost?

1962
02:11:15,318 --> 02:11:16,859
You must have...

1963
02:11:18,443 --> 02:11:20,484
...felt like dying, right?

1964
02:11:32,651 --> 02:11:33,651
No.

1965
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:42,318
No.

1966
02:11:45,193 --> 02:11:46,068
No.

1967
02:11:47,609 --> 02:11:48,526
No way.

1968
02:11:50,193 --> 02:11:51,234
Not at all.

1969
02:11:54,318 --> 02:11:55,318
No.

1970
02:11:58,693 --> 02:11:59,526
No.

1971
02:12:05,859 --> 02:12:08,276
Because from that day onwards...

1972
02:12:09,359 --> 02:12:10,651
...we weren't losers anymore.

1973
02:12:12,484 --> 02:12:17,068
H3, H3!

1974
02:12:17,443 --> 02:12:19,818
H3, H3!

1975
02:12:19,984 --> 02:12:22,359
H3, H3!

1976
02:12:22,818 --> 02:12:25,109
H3, H3!

1977
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:27,901
Guys...
One sec, guys.

1978
02:12:30,318 --> 02:12:31,568
Hey champs...

1979
02:12:36,151 --> 02:12:37,276
Well played.

1980
02:12:39,109 --> 02:12:40,193
No, really.

1981
02:12:41,151 --> 02:12:42,234
Well played.

1982
02:12:44,026 --> 02:12:45,276
For H4, boys.

1983
02:13:49,401 --> 02:13:50,651
Son...

1984
02:13:53,068 --> 02:13:55,196
Your result doesn't decide...

1985
02:13:56,234 --> 02:13:57,568
...whether you are a loser or not.

1986
02:13:58,859 --> 02:14:00,859
What matters is how hard you tried.

1987
02:14:04,193 --> 02:14:06,571
And you give it your best shot.

1988
02:14:07,318 --> 02:14:08,193
Right?

1989
02:14:12,651 --> 02:14:13,651
Yes.

1990
02:14:16,151 --> 02:14:17,068
Okay, guys!

1991
02:14:18,484 --> 02:14:19,818
Time to take Raghav now.

1992
02:14:24,193 --> 02:14:25,609
Listen to me...

1993
02:14:29,734 --> 02:14:30,743
Now go...

1994
02:14:32,151 --> 02:14:34,193
...but not like a loser...

1995
02:14:36,859 --> 02:14:40,212
Go like a fighter.

1996
02:15:51,273 --> 02:15:55,232
'In the past few days, I
have learnt a very important lesson.

1997
02:15:56,193 --> 02:15:58,984
'We are so engrossed in winning,
losing, success and failure...'

1998
02:15:59,330 --> 02:16:02,713
'...that we have forgotten
how to live our lives.'

1999
02:16:03,651 --> 02:16:06,276
'The most important thing
in life...'

2000
02:16:06,693 --> 02:16:08,943
'...is life itself.'

2001
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:15,235
'I went to college the next year.'

2002
02:16:15,734 --> 02:16:20,344
'Don't ask me my department
or my All India Rank.'

2003
02:16:21,026 --> 02:16:22,276
'I was happy.'

2004
02:16:22,734 --> 02:16:24,193
'I was going to college.'

2005
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:27,068
'To make new friends.'

2006
02:16:27,609 --> 02:16:29,151
'To live my life.'

2007
02:16:39,693 --> 02:16:41,026
Welcome, freshie!

2008
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:44,026
Have you done anything
else in life besides studying?

2009
02:16:45,068 --> 02:16:46,151
Do you make yourself happy?

2010
02:16:47,984 --> 02:16:49,267
Why are you looking over there?

2011
02:17:52,818 --> 02:17:56,568
"What will you gain by worrying?"

2012
02:17:56,651 --> 02:18:01,026
"You will die before actually dying"

2013
02:18:07,443 --> 02:18:12,109
"What will you gain by worrying?"

2014
02:18:12,193 --> 02:18:15,693
"You will die before actually dying"

2015
02:18:15,776 --> 02:18:19,068
"This song will help you out."

2016
02:18:19,151 --> 02:18:22,943
"Eat, drink,
and live because life is short."

2017
02:18:23,026 --> 02:18:26,609
"Don't worry, silly."

2018
02:18:26,693 --> 02:18:30,526
"Don't worry, silly."

2019
02:18:30,609 --> 02:18:32,776
"Take life as it comes."

2020
02:18:32,859 --> 02:18:35,109
"Don't worry, silly."

2021
02:18:50,774 --> 02:18:58,568
"Unnecessarily worrying
about your future happiness"

2022
02:18:58,651 --> 02:19:06,401
"Why ruin your present
by filling it with sadness?"

2023
02:19:14,151 --> 02:19:21,734
"Unnecessarily worrying
about your future happiness"

2024
02:19:21,818 --> 02:19:29,068
"Why ruin your present
by filling it with sadness?"

2025
02:19:29,568 --> 02:19:33,526
"What sometimes cannot
be achieved as a rabbit"

2026
02:19:33,609 --> 02:19:37,859
"Can be easily
achieved as a tortoise"

2027
02:19:45,068 --> 02:19:48,943
"What sometimes cannot
be achieved as a rabbit"

2028
02:19:49,026 --> 02:19:52,568
"Can be easily
achieved as a tortoise"

2029
02:19:52,651 --> 02:19:55,859
"This song will help you out."

2030
02:19:55,943 --> 02:19:59,568
"Eat, drink,
and live because life is short."

2031
02:19:59,651 --> 02:20:03,484
"Don't worry, silly."

2032
02:20:03,568 --> 02:20:07,401
"Don't worry, silly."

2033
02:20:07,484 --> 02:20:09,651
"Take life as it comes."

2034
02:20:09,734 --> 02:20:12,234
"Don't worry, silly."
